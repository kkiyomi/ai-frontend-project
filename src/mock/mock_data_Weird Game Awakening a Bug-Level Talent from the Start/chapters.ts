    "translatedContent": "Chapter 1: F-Level Talent, Death Roll Call  \n\n[Welcome to the Eerie World, a cursed realm where you will integrate as a Player.]  \n\n[Remember, humans are at the bottom of the food chain here—the most delicious prey for the supernatural. To survive, strive to complete Missions and earn their favor.]  \n\n[Warning: There is no true death in this world. Elimination only plunges you into more terrifying dungeons, facing even more despairing trials.]  \n\n[You have been assigned the initial dungeon—Crimson Apartment.]  \n\nThe room was like a drop of ink dispersing in clear water—dark, suffocating, swallowing all light.  \n\nJi Yan opened his eyes.  \n\nHis brain short-circuited for a moment.  \n\nHaving bought countless scratch-off tickets before, he’d never won more than 20 bucks. Yet here he was, hitting the jackpot on odds of one in millions.  \n\nGuess this is what they call being \"chosen by fate\"...  \n\nHis smile carried a trace of bitterness.  \n\nAt that moment, a virtual game panel popped into view.  \n\n[At dawn, the supernatural entities will awaken. Use this time to familiarize yourself with the surroundings and gather intel—it might just boost your survival odds.]  \n\n[Room 404 holds 3 Players and 3 supernatural entities. Interacting with each entity triggers unique Missions. Failure to complete them will result in varying degrees of Punishment.]  \n\nHesitation meant defeat.  \n\nRather than wallow in despair, it was better to pull himself together and focus on survival.  \n\nJi Yan patted his cheeks, scanned the shabby room, and stepped outside.  \n\nSoon, he spotted two others in the living room—clearly the remaining Players.  \n\nThey were hunched over the dining table, shoveling down a sludgy, unappetizing meal. Despite its revolting appearance, they ate with alarming speed, barely chewing before swallowing.  \n\nThis wasn’t eating. This was fueling.  \n\nThe female Player noticed Ji Yan and blinked in surprise.  \n\nThe male Player didn’t even glance up, still mechanically devouring his food.  \n\n\"Well, this is new,\" the girl mused, her twin ponytails swaying as she studied Ji Yan with unexpected curiosity. \"How long has it been since our little hovel got a fresh Player?\"  \n\nThe boy tore off a chunk of blackened meat and shot her a sidelong glare. \"Why bother caring? Newbies come and go.\"  \n\n\"Use this time to stuff your face instead. Once those freaks wake up, even a sip of water’ll be hard to come by!\"  \n\nThe girl immediately ducked her head and resumed scarfing down her meal.  \n\nJi Yan approached, eyeing the pot of dubious sustenance.  \n\nThe boy yanked the dish closer, his gaze icy with possessiveness. \"This is ours. No share for you.\"  \n\n\"Want food? Go earn it by completing Missions!\"  \n\nThe male Player had zero goodwill toward newcomers.  \n\nThese greenhorns never understood the rules.  \n\nHelp them once, and they’d cling like parasites—pestering you at every minor hurdle, dragging you down with them.  \n\nUseless deadweight.  \n\n\"I just wanted to learn the basics of this dungeon’s rules,\" Ji Yan said, fully aware of his newbie status. These two were clearly veterans who’d survived here for a while.  \n\nIn this unfamiliar environment, with zero intel at hand, his only option was to fish for clues from the old-timers...  \n\nThe boy scoffed but stayed silent.  \n\nThe girl, however, believed in lending a hand when possible. More allies meant greater strength—who knew when she might need help in return?\n\nShe summarized briefly: \"In this house, we all play the roles of children, while the other three supernatural entities take on the roles of father, mother, and grandmother. If you want to live here and get food, you must unconditionally complete the tasks assigned by those three entities every day.\"  \n\n\"Oh, let me introduce myself. I’m Liu Yitong, and he’s Dong Chu.\"  \n\nThe moment his name was mentioned, Dong Chu visibly bristled.  \n\nHe shot a glance over, sneering, \"Liu, you beauty, have you forgotten what happened the last time you helped a new player?\"  \n\n\"After that, he clung to you like a leech. Even when he stepped on a landmine, he tried to drag you down with him. Still haven’t learned your lesson?\"  \n\nHe cursed inwardly—this woman never learned.  \n\nAt the mention of the last newcomer, Liu Yitong’s pretty face darkened.  \n\nShe glanced at Ji Yan but said nothing more, quietly finishing the last of her food.  \n\nDong Chu suddenly seemed to remember something and, surprisingly, took the initiative to speak to Ji Yan: \"Every player has a [Talent Trait]. Open your personal info panel and see what grade yours is.\"  \n\nThe Talent Trait was a feature all players possessed.  \n\nIt was a kind of welfare mechanism for players, mainly divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. The higher the grade, the better the trait, granting players greater privileges in dungeons.  \n\nThough Dong Chu disliked newcomers, if a new player awakened a useful talent, they could be a major asset—sometimes even more valuable than veteran players.  \n\nSo, he decided to ask.  \n\nMight as well see if this rookie had any exploitable worth.  \n\nLiu Yitong chimed in, \"Right. For example, my talent is C-grade, called [Natural Charm]. It’s a passive trait.\"  \n\n\"In any dungeon, my face is more appealing to supernatural entities than other players'. In other words, my favorability is 5% higher than average.\"  \n\n\"Don’t underestimate that 5%. Once, during a mission, another player and I both triggered a trap. The entity had to choose one of us for punishment.\"  \n\n\"In the end, because I was more likable, the other guy got unlucky!\"  \n\nAs she spoke, a smug look crossed her delicate features.  \n\nDong Chu scoffed, \"How ironic. Even in the Eerie World, looks matter.\"  \n\nJi Yan opened his info panel.  \n\nIgnoring the basic stat bars at the top, his gaze landed on the final column—[Talent Trait]. The glaring [F] stood out like a sore thumb.  \n\n\"F??\"  \n\nJi Yan froze.  \n\n\"What the hell? I thought the lowest was D-grade. How did you get an F?\"  \n\nEven the two veteran players were stunned by an F-grade talent.  \n\nD-grade talents were already so weak they were practically useless.  \n\nFor example, one person’s D-grade talent—[Swift as Wind]—granted the privilege of \"teleporting\" in dungeons.  \n\nAt first glance, it sounded overpowered, but in reality, it only allowed a 2-centimeter teleport. Useless.  \n\nAnother ridiculous D-grade talent—[Vanish Without Trace]—let players \"turn invisible\" in dungeons, but the effect broke the moment they got close to another player or supernatural entity.  \n\nOn the surface, these talents sounded impressive, but once slapped with a D-grade label, they were nerfed into oblivion!\n\n\"D-grade is already abstract enough for the gutter. I can’t even imagine how much worse an F-grade must be!\"  \n\nDong Chu immediately frowned, the last shred of goodwill vanishing from his expression. He wanted nothing to do with such an unlucky wretch.  \n\n\"An F-grade talent might even bring misfortune to players who get too close. Let him fend for himself.\"  \n\nLiu Yitong’s eyes also held pity, but she wasn’t as calculating. Instinctively, she offered comfort.  \n\n\"Don’t lose heart. It’s still better than nothing. What really matters is the player’s own ability.\"  \n\nJi Yan wondered inwardly—was he cursed by the god of misfortune?  \n\nUnwilling to give up, he tapped open the detailed description of his talent.  \n\n[Talent: Passive, F-grade.]\n\n[Name: Know the Root and Bottom.]\n\n[Details: Through eye contact, you can glimpse the underwear of all Supernatural Entities and players.]\n\nJi Yan’s vision darkened.  \n\nWell.  \n\nThis talent was truly shocking!\n\nBut then, a notification chimed in his mind.  \n\n\"Ding! Player has successfully awakened a talent—F-grade. Due to a BUG, this is a discarded talent.\"\n\n\"Because the BUG took effect, your talent has been modified—\"\n\n[Talent Name: Omniscient Understanding.]\n\n[Talent Details: Triggered by touching a Supernatural Entity’s personal item, allowing you to obtain all hidden information about the entity.]\n\nA few simple lines of text left Ji Yan stunned.  \n\nSo this was what F-grade really meant!\n\nBut why had he awakened a discarded, bugged talent?  \n\nHe had no idea.  \n\nRight now, though, Ji Yan didn’t have the luxury to dwell on it. Just a single line of description made it clear how valuable this talent was.  \n\nHe could uncover all hidden information about Supernatural Entities!\n\nThat meant he didn’t have to risk his life like other players, painstakingly gathering scraps of intel to strategize.  \n\nAll he had to do was touch something, and he could expose every secret of every Supernatural Entity!  \n\nJi Yan decided not to reveal the BUG in his talent.  \n\nA trump card like this—best kept hidden for as long as possible.  \n\nShowing off might satisfy his ego, but it had no real benefit.  \n\nA brightly blooming flower attracts attention, but it’s also the first to be plucked and wither.  \n\nJust then, the mottled pendulum clock struck again—six times in total.  \n\nSix in the morning. Dawn had arrived.  \n\nThe Supernatural Entity was awake!  \n\nDong Chu and the other player, who had been eating just moments ago, now moved like soldiers at the sound of a whistle. They swiftly cleared the table and bolted toward the dormitory hallway.  \n\nAs Ji Yan followed, he heard eerie scratching noises from the doors.  \n\nEerie because they sounded like something sharp dragging across the wood—piercing and unsettling.\n\nThen, as the stench of rot filled the air, a hoarse, ragged voice, as if torn from shredded vocal cords, drifted out from the dark corridor...  \n\n\"Has a new child arrived today? Come to Father’s room. Let me see how strong your body is.\"\n\nJi Yan’s lips twitched.  \n\nSeriously?  \n\nThe first words after waking up—and he was specifically summoned?",

    "content": "第2章隐藏信息，魅诡任务\n\n在听到父亲诡的声音后，董洁和刘艺桐心头都咯噔一下。\n随即，衰神般看着纪言。\n这个新人开出了屎逝级的F级天赋就算了。\n游戏刚开始，就被雷区最多，死亡率最高的父亲诡直接点名！\n这得是多衰？\n董洁甚至都怀疑，F级天赋是不是自带倒霉属性？\n纪言的脸色也不好看。\n按照刘艺桐的介绍，\n屋内四房一厅布局，三间是诡异的，一间是玩家的。\n其中，雷区最少的是母亲，她对孩子异常的喜爱，不用担心关系恶化。\n只是因为过分畸形的爱意，往往会触发头疼危险的任务……\n其次是奶奶，或许是刘艺桐的天赋缘故，唯独宠爱她一个，对男玩家没什么好感。\n雷区最多的就是父亲。\n脾气暴躁，性格古怪，对自己的孩子更是尤其厌恶，甚至是刻意针对，鸡蛋里挑骨头。\n此前，大部份玩家都栽在父亲诡上！\n在董褚和刘艺桐送终似的目光下，纪言硬着头皮走进了昏暗的通道内。\n房门缓缓推开，寝室内的吊灯摇曳，散发暗沉的橘光。\n纪言前脚刚进来，后脚房门就紧紧关上。\n浓烈的血腥味充斥室内，在纪言视线中，清晰地看到地板上散落着大量血淋淋的碎块……\n一个身上插满钢钉，皮肤血肉就像打了过量激素，跟爆米花似的膨胀，长满了惊悚恶心的肉瘤的诡怪，正咧着嘴角盯着纪言。\n它捏着一颗还沾着许多碎肉的头骨，笑眯眯地对纪言问：“知道这是谁吗？”\n盯着那眼窝内攀爬的蛆虫，纪言沉默一下，平静说道：“我的哥哥，或者姐姐吧？”\n父亲诡有些意外，将头骨扔到了纪言怀里：“挺聪明。”\n“还有很多你的哥哥姐姐在这里，要看看吗？”\n他站起身来，那庞大的身躯如同黑熊一样，压迫而危险，掀开了一个柜子。\n那柜子里，堆积了十几颗头骨，血肉都被踢干净，爬满苍蝇驱虫。\n画面十分冲击眼球。\n“知道为什么他们都留在了这里吗？”\n面对父亲诡那戏谑的眼神，纪言低声道：“他们让父亲你生气了。”\n“原来你也知道我的脾气不好。”\n“我不喜欢不听话，能力差，做事还笨拙的孩子。”\n“比如你，我喊了你这么久，为什么现在才进来？”\n“摘你一只耳朵，下次长记性！”\n父亲诡的面目下一秒变地狰狞可怖，大手朝着纪言的小身板抓来。\n纪言嘴角一抽。\n不是，这么离谱的吗？\n只是慢一点进房间，也算踩中雷区，这要玩家怎么活？\n下意识想后退，但下一秒纪言盯着手中的头骨，却又眼神一动。\n他迅速稳住了心神，任由那只大手抓来。\n最终，大手并没有伤害纪言，悻悻收了回去。\n没有见到恐吓的效果，父亲诡眯缝的眼神变地有些阴森。\n猩红嘴角扯起难听的笑声：“跟你开个玩笑，怎么没点反应，被吓傻了？”\n如果纪言刚才躲闪，或者是表现出惊惶失措的举动，那么它会真的摘掉纪言的一只耳朵！\n纪言没回应，眼神盯着手中的血腥头骨。\n只见上面弹出了一块红色面板。\n“叮！恭喜玩家触碰物品，触发天赋【全知全解】，获得隐藏信息。”\n“诡异种类：魇食诡”\n“能力：喜欢通过恐吓手段，来使玩家产生恐惧值，以此为食，被吃掉的恐惧值越多，玩家精神意识和身体机能骤减越厉害。”\n“致命弱点：一柄生前刺伤它的怨念匕首。”\n这就是BUG级别的天赋吗？\n只靠一个相关物品，就能把整个诡异的详解、能力、甚至是弱点都探的一干二净！\n纪言眼睛闪烁。\n他想过这天赋很霸道，但没想到会这么霸道！\n不过，这把所谓的怨念匕首会在哪里？\n如果能拿到手的话，好歹多一张保命的底牌。\n纪言没有多去想，现在首要的还是先活着离开房间。\n“我最近腿有些疼痛的厉害，你想办法弄到一个叫【血琵琶】的药物。”\n“天黑之前，送到房间。”\n“没有药物，我拿你来缓解疼痛，没用的孩子不配留在这个屋内！”\n钨丝灯泡的光线下，魇食诡撕开裤脚，露出那条臃肿的腿，上面血肉溃烂，掉落着一块块乳白褐黄的脂肪体，十分恶心。\n纪言不知道血琵琶是个什么东西。\n但动动脑筋都知道，这里面肯定没这么简单！\n“明白了，父亲。”\n纪言点点头。\n得到答复，身后房门打开一条缝隙，纪言这才得以离开房间。\n“叮！恭喜玩家成功领取任务，18:00分前找到物品【血琵琶】，送至父亲卧室。”\n“任务成功，可获取C级奖励。”\n“任务失败，将受到父亲30分钟，无生命危险的任务惩罚。”\n听到惩罚，纪言眉头皱起。\n虽然表明惩罚不会丧命，但更多的惩罚可比死亡更加痛苦折磨！\n要说没压力，那肯定假的。\n前脚刚出来，一边的母亲和奶奶的房间跟着打开，董褚和刘艺桐跟着出来。\n他们在看到纪言的一刹那，都带着诧异。\n“你居然这么快出来？”\n“身体掉了什么零件？”\n纪言反问：“我应该掉什么零件？”\n刘艺桐俏脸愕然：“你怎么做到的，董褚第一次进入父亲的房间，都被摘掉了一颗腰子。”\n这话一出，董褚脸色顿时一黑。\n“刘大美女，有些事没必要提就不要提！”\n刘艺桐并不在意董褚的眼神，自顾自地说道：“父亲那只诡就喜欢刁难恐吓玩家，可实际上，在这个公寓内有着一套隐藏规则，约束着诡异。”\n“诡异无法肆无忌惮地伤害玩家，只有通过派发任务失败，才能惩罚玩家。”\n“所以，心理承受能力是关键。”\n纪言点点头：“谢了。”\n一提到任务，董褚的脸色就阴沉下来：“该死的，今天不知道那个老太婆抽什么风？说假牙坏了，要我去给他弄一副！”\n“任务判定为A级！”\nA级任务死亡率高达50%，因为假牙这个物品，指示5楼才能找到。\n而在这个公寓里，楼层越高的住户越恐怖！\n摸鱼了数天的董褚，今天纪言一来，就中了大奖。\n他都怀疑是不是这个该死的新人，自带的霉运传染到他身上了。\n“我还好，母亲那只诡一直对我有不少好感度，只让我去下楼借一瓶酱油。”\n“系统判定任务等级是C级。”\n刘艺桐说着，看在纪言身上：“你呢，派发了什么任务？”\n纪言摸摸鼻子，“我也挺好，C级任务。”\n“那只诡让我找一个叫【血琵琶】的药物，给它治腿。”\n可一听到血琵琶，纪言注意到两人的脸色都变地古怪起来。\n“血琵琶？呵呵，果然我猜的没错，那只诡又派了这个任务。”\n“你中大奖了！”\n董褚笑着离开了，可那份笑容，怎么听都像是在幸灾乐祸。\n纪言眉头微皱：“这血琵琶很难找？”\n刘艺桐微微叹气：“这个血琵琶不难找，我们都知道在哪里，公寓的101房间。”\n“但在你之前，已经有四个玩家都被委派这个任务，只有一个活着回来。”\n“唯一回来的那个，像老了几十岁，全身没有一点血肉，话没讲两句人就没了……”\n刘艺桐眼神怜悯：“所以，我建议你，最好想想别的出路。”\n“这101房间，是吃人的怪物！”\n纪言：“……”",
    "translatedContent": "Chapter 2: Hidden Information, the Supernatural Entity's Mission  \n\nUpon hearing the voice of the Father Supernatural Entity, both Dong Jie and Liu Yitong's hearts skipped a beat.  \n\nImmediately, they looked at Ji Yan as if he were a harbinger of misfortune.  \n\nThis newcomer had already drawn the shit-tier F-Level Talent, and now, right at the start of the game, he was directly called out by the Father Supernatural Entity—the most dangerous and lethal entity in the entire Danger Zone!  \n\nJust how unlucky could one be?  \n\nDong Jie even began to suspect whether the F-Level Talent came with an innate curse of bad luck.  \n\nJi Yan’s expression wasn’t great either.  \n\nAccording to Liu Yitong’s explanation,  \n\nthe apartment had a layout of four rooms and one living area, with three belonging to the Supernatural Entities and one reserved for the Players.  \n\nAmong them, the least dangerous was the Mother. She had an abnormal fondness for her \"children,\" so there was no need to worry about worsening relations.  \n\nHowever, due to her excessively twisted affection, she often assigned missions that could trigger life-threatening headaches…  \n\nNext was the Grandmother. Perhaps because of Liu Yitong’s talent, she favored her exclusively and had little goodwill toward male Players.  \n\nThe most dangerous of all was the Father.  \n\nTemperamental, eccentric, and harboring a particular hatred for his \"children,\" he would even go out of his way to nitpick and find fault.  \n\nPreviously, the majority of Players had met their end at the hands of the Father Supernatural Entity!  \n\nUnder the funeral-like gazes of Dong Chu and Liu Yitong, Ji Yan steeled himself and stepped into the dimly lit corridor.  \n\nThe door creaked open slowly, revealing a bedroom where a swaying ceiling lamp cast a murky orange glow.  \n\nThe moment Ji Yan stepped inside, the door slammed shut behind him.  \n\nA thick, metallic stench of blood filled the room. In Ji Yan’s line of sight, he could clearly see the floor littered with bloody, mangled remains…  \n\nA grotesque figure, its body riddled with steel nails, its skin and flesh swollen like overinflated popcorn from excessive hormones, covered in horrifying, disgusting tumors, stared at Ji Yan with a twisted grin.  \n\nHolding a skull still smeared with bits of flesh, it asked cheerfully, \"Do you know who this is?\"  \n\nStaring at the maggots crawling out of the eye sockets, Ji Yan fell silent for a moment before answering calmly, \"My older brother… or sister, I suppose?\"  \n\nThe Father Supernatural Entity seemed surprised. He tossed the skull into Ji Yan’s arms. \"Quite clever.\"  \n\n\"There are plenty more of your brothers and sisters here. Would you like to see them?\"  \n\nHe stood up, his massive frame looming like a black bear—oppressive and dangerous—before yanking open a cabinet.  \n\nInside, dozens of skulls were piled up, their flesh long scraped clean, swarming with flies and maggots.  \n\nThe sight was utterly horrifying.  \n\n\"Do you know why they all ended up here?\"  \n\nFacing the Father’s mocking gaze, Ji Yan replied softly, \"They made you angry, Father.\"  \n\n\"So you do know I have a temper.\"  \n\n\"I don’t like disobedient, incompetent, or clumsy children.\"  \n\n\"For example—you. I called for you so long ago. Why did you only come in now?\"  \n\n\"I’ll take one of your ears as a reminder for next time!\"  \n\nIn the next second, the Father’s face twisted into a terrifying snarl as his massive hand lunged toward Ji Yan’s slender frame.  \n\nJi Yan’s lips twitched.  \n\nSeriously? This absurd?  \n\nJust being a little slow to enter the room counted as stepping into the Danger Zone? How were Players supposed to survive this?  \n\nInstinctively, he wanted to retreat, but the next moment, his gaze fell on the skull in his hands, and his eyes flickered with realization.  \n\nHe steadied himself and allowed the massive hand to reach for him.  \n\nIn the end, the hand didn’t harm Ji Yan. It withdrew reluctantly.\n\nNot seeing the intended intimidating effect, the Father Supernatural Entity's narrowed eyes turned sinister.  \n\nIts crimson lips twisted into an unpleasant grin. \"Just a joke—why no reaction? Scared stiff?\"  \n\nHad Ji Yan flinched or shown panic, it would have genuinely torn off one of his ears!  \n\nJi Yan didn’t respond, his gaze fixed on the bloody skull in his hands.  \n\nSuddenly, a red panel popped up above it.  \n\nDing! Congratulations, Player, for touching the item and triggering the talent [Omniscient Understanding], obtaining hidden information.\n\nSupernatural Entity Type: Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity\n\nAbility: Preys on Fear Value generated through intimidation. The more Fear Value consumed, the sharper the decline in the player’s mental state and physical functions.\n\nFatal Weakness: A Grudge Dagger that once wounded it in life.\n\nSo this was the power of a BUG-level talent?  \n\nJust by touching a related object, it could reveal the entire entity’s details, abilities, and even its weakness!  \n\nJi Yan’s eyes gleamed.  \n\nHe had expected this talent to be overpowered—but not this overpowered!\n\nStill, where was this so-called Grudge Dagger?  \n\nIf he could get his hands on it, he’d at least have another life-saving card.  \n\nBut Ji Yan didn’t dwell on it. His priority now was simply surviving and leaving the room.  \n\n\"My leg has been hurting badly lately. Get me a medicine called [Blood Pipa].\"  \n\n\"Deliver it to my room before nightfall.\"  \n\n\"No medicine? Then I’ll use you to ease the pain. Useless children don’t deserve to stay in this house!\"\n\nUnder the flickering light of the tungsten bulb, the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity rolled up its pant leg, revealing a swollen, rotting limb. Flesh sloughed off in patches, exposing chunks of yellowish-white fat—utterly revolting.  \n\nJi Yan had no idea what the Blood Pipa was.  \n\nBut it didn’t take a genius to realize this wouldn’t be simple.  \n\n\"Understood, Father.\"  \n\nJi Yan nodded.  \n\nWith his reply, the door behind him creaked open a sliver, allowing him to finally exit.  \n\nDing! Congratulations, Player, for successfully accepting the mission: Locate the item [Blood Pipa] and deliver it to Father’s bedroom by 18:00.\n\nMission Success: Obtain a C-grade reward.\n\nMission Failure: Receive a 30-minute non-lethal punishment from Father.\n\nHearing the punishment, Ji Yan frowned.  \n\nThough it claimed to be non-fatal, some punishments were worse than death—far more agonizing.  \n\nTo say he wasn’t stressed would be a lie.  \n\nNo sooner had he stepped out than the doors to the Mother and Grandmother’s rooms opened as well. Dong Chu and Liu Yitong emerged, both startled at the sight of him.  \n\n\"You got out that fast?\"\n\n\"What body part did you lose?\"  \n\nJi Yan countered, \"What part should I have lost?\"\n\nLiu Yitong blinked in disbelief. \"How did you manage that? Dong Chu lost a kidney the first time he entered Father’s room.\"  \n\nDong Chu’s face darkened instantly.  \n\n\"Liu, some things don’t need to be mentioned!\"\n\nUnfazed by his glare, Liu Yitong continued, \"That Father Supernatural Entity loves tormenting and scaring players. But in reality, this apartment has a set of Hidden Rules that restrict the supernatural entities.\"\n\n\"Supernatural Entities cannot harm Players indiscriminately. They can only punish Players for failing assigned Missions.\"  \n\n\"So, psychological resilience is key.\"  \n\nJi Yan nodded. \"Thanks.\"  \n\nThe moment Missions were mentioned, Dong Chu's expression darkened. \"Damn it, I don’t know what’s gotten into that old hag today! She said her dentures broke and wants me to fetch her a new pair!\"  \n\n\"The Mission was rated as an A-grade task!\"  \n\nA-grade tasks had a mortality rate as high as 50%, because the dentures could only be found on the 5th floor.  \n\nAnd in this apartment, the higher the floor, the more terrifying the residents!  \n\nDong Chu, who had been slacking off for days, hit the jackpot the moment Ji Yan arrived. He even wondered if this damn newcomer had somehow cursed him with bad luck.  \n\n\"I’m doing alright. The Mother Supernatural Entity has always favored me. She just asked me to borrow a bottle of soy sauce downstairs.\"  \n\n\"The system rated it as a C-grade task.\"  \n\nLiu Yitong spoke, then turned to Ji Yan. \"What about you? What Mission were you assigned?\"  \n\nJi Yan rubbed his nose. \"I’m fine too—a C-grade task.\"  \n\n\"That Supernatural Entity asked me to find a medicine called the 'Blood Pipa' to treat its leg.\"  \n\nBut the moment they heard \"Blood Pipa,\" Ji Yan noticed their expressions shift strangely.  \n\n\"Blood Pipa? Hah, I knew it. That Supernatural Entity assigned this Mission again.\"  \n\n\"You hit the jackpot!\"  \n\nDong Chu walked away laughing, but his laughter carried an unmistakable tone of schadenfreude.  \n\nJi Yan frowned slightly. \"Is the Blood Pipa hard to find?\"  \n\nLiu Yitong sighed softly. \"It’s not hard to find. We all know where it is—Room 101 in the apartment.\"  \n\n\"But before you, four Players were assigned this Mission. Only one came back alive.\"  \n\n\"The one who returned looked decades older, with no flesh left on his body. He barely spoke two words before he was gone...\"  \n\nLiu Yitong’s gaze was full of pity. \"So, I suggest you think of another way out.\"  \n\n\"Room 101 is a man-eating monster!\"  \n\nJi Yan: \"...\"",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 3: Mission Start, the Horror Behind the Door  \n\nJi Yan had guessed it wouldn’t be so simple.  \n\nBut after hearing Liu Yitong’s words, his expression still darkened.  \n\nWhat kind of monstrous thing lived inside Room 101?  \n\n\"Good luck to you.\"  \n\n\"Hope I’ll still see you at dinner tonight.\"  \n\nLiu Yitong had never seen such an unlucky newcomer before.  \n\nLeaving behind a feeble encouragement, she also left the apartment, hurrying to complete her own mission.  \n\nAs fellow players, giving a kind warning was already going above and beyond.  \n\nFinding a way to survive would still be up to him.  \n\nJi Yan pondered for a moment before turning and leaving the apartment as well.  \n\nNo matter what, he still had to investigate Room 101—he couldn’t be scared off by just a few words.  \n\nFollowing the location Liu Yitong had mentioned, Ji Yan quickly made his way through the filthy hallway and soon reached the first floor of the apartment.  \n\nOutside Room 101, two other players had been waiting for some time.  \n\n\"What, another newcomer?\" Vest Man glanced at Ji Yan emerging from the hallway, slightly surprised.  \n\n\"Clean clothes, clear eyes—definitely a rookie,\" Middle-Part Man remarked, arms crossed, yawning.  \n\nJi Yan remained silent.  \n\nUpon noticing Ji Yan was a newcomer, Vest Man and Middle-Part Man exchanged a knowing look.  \n\nThis kind of clueless rookie was easy to manipulate.  \n\nIn the apartment, tricking new players into scouting danger zones was an unwritten rule among veterans...  \n\n\"Newbie, I’ve dealt with the resident of Room 101 a few times. If you want to live, listen to me. I don’t mind guiding a rookie,\" Vest Man offered.  \n\n\"Then I’ll leave it to you.\"  \n\nJi Yan nodded calmly.  \n\nHe wasn’t blind—he’d caught the look they’d exchanged.  \n\nIn a place like the Eerie World, where everyone was fighting to survive, who had the time to help others for no reason?  \n\nHe hadn’t even fully trusted Liu Yitong’s words.  \n\nMoreover, judging by their relaxed demeanor, it seemed they had no idea how dangerous Room 101 really was?  \n\nJi Yan’s eyes gleamed. With his advantage in information, perhaps he could use these two to gauge just how deep the waters inside the room ran.  \n\nThe three at the door hadn’t even stepped inside yet, but each already harbored their own schemes.  \n\nCreak—\n\nThe door to Room 101 slowly opened, revealing a man’s head. His hollow, lifeless eyes fixed on the three of them.  \n\n\"We’re here to—\" Vest Man took a step forward, about to state their purpose, but was cut off.  \n\n\"Here for the mission. I know.\"  \n\n\"Come in first. There’s a queue.\"  \n\nWith that, the White-Clothed Man stepped aside, pulling the door open.  \n\nFacing the abyss-like darkness inside, the three exchanged glances before mustering their courage and stepping in.  \n\nBut just as Ji Yan was the last to enter, he suddenly felt a sharp sting at his waist. Looking down, he realized he’d been injected with something!  \n\nAs the White-Clothed Man expressionlessly withdrew the needle, Ji Yan tried to speak—but the next moment, the world spun, and darkness swallowed him.  \n\n......  \n\nHe didn’t know how much time had passed.  \n\nA bone-chilling cold jolted Ji Yan awake. When he opened his eyes, he found himself in a pitch-black room.  \n\nIf it could even be called a room—it was more like an icy prison cell!  \n\nDim. Damp.  \n\nChains. Shackles!  \n\nA metal table covered in unspeakable \"torture tools.\"\n\nJi Yan tried to move but found his hands and feet shackled with chains. Turning his head, he saw the other two accompanying players had suffered the same fate.  \n\nThe white-clothed man who had opened the door was now sitting on the filthy floor.  \n\nHe was eating a plate of mushy, liquid-like food while staring at them with unsettling eyes.  \n\n\"What the hell is this?\"  \n\n\"We're tenants! You're violating the apartment rules—do you know the consequences? Unlock these damn shackles now!\"  \n\nVest Man and Middle-Part Man yanked at the chains, shouting at the white-clothed man.  \n\nEven as veteran players, they were completely baffled—this was the first time they'd encountered such an absurd mission start.  \n\nGet injected the moment they step in.  \n\nWake up already chained.  \n\nWhat kind of messed-up game was this?  \n\nThe white-clothed man remained silent, calmly watching Vest Man and Middle-Part Man scream as he ate.  \n\nOnly Ji Yan stayed quiet, swiftly scanning their surroundings.  \n\nIn several corners, he spotted shriveled, doll-like figures...  \n\nNo—those weren’t dolls. They were corpses!  \n\nDrained of flesh and blood, leaving only a thin layer of skin clinging to the bones, appearing almost weightless...  \n\nClearly, these were former players.  \n\nJi Yan’s expression darkened. This matched exactly what Liu Yitong had described.  \n\nOnce Vest Man and Middle-Part Man had shouted themselves hoarse, the white-clothed man stopped eating and asked, \"Finished?\"  \n\nBefore they could respond, the white-clothed man suddenly stood up, pulling a knuckle duster from his pocket and slipping it on.  \n\nThen, without warning, he smashed it into Middle-Part Man’s skull—once, twice, the spikes piercing through bone, blood splattering.  \n\nThud—squelch—thud—squelch—\n\nSoon, the scene was a gory mess. Middle-Part Man was officially \"logged out.\"  \n\nThe white-clothed man turned to Vest Man and asked, \"Can you be quiet now?\"  \n\nVest Man, pale-faced, nodded.  \n\nWiping blood from his face, the white-clothed man sneered, \"Pathetic. A little blood and you fold.\"  \n\nA little blood?! His brains are splattered everywhere!\n\nJi Yan stared at the white-clothed man, wondering—Is this the master of Room 101?\n\nBut the next second, the man spoke again: \"Let me introduce myself. I’m Cheng Fang, a player living in Room 101.\"  \n\nBoth of them froze.  \n\nThis guy, who had just coldly bashed someone’s skull in without a second thought, was also a player?\n\nNoticing their shocked expressions, Cheng Fang waved a hand, feigning helplessness. \"Don’t look at me like I’m some psycho. I’m just a poor worker stuck in a bad job.\"  \n\n\"Killing him? First, to shut you up.\"  \n\n\"Second, that Supernatural entity doesn’t like skinny ones—no nutrients. I have to filter out the low-quality stock.\"\n\nHearing these absurd reasons, Vest Man instinctively glanced at Ji Yan, as if to say, Isn’t this guy just as skinny?\n\nCheng Fang also looked at Ji Yan. \"He’s quiet.\"  \n\nJi Yan: \"...\"  \n\n\"I’ll keep it short. It’s simple.\"  \n\n\"See that room behind me? Go in, come out, and your mission’s done.\"  \n\nVest Man’s expression screamed, You think we’re idiots?\n\nJi Yan finally spoke up: \"Going in is easy. Coming out... probably not so simple, right?\"\n\nCheng Fang didn’t mince words, pointing at the shriveled corpses in the corner: \"If you can’t make it out, you’ll end up like them.\"  \n\n\"Don’t worry, though. My job is to handle the bodies. If you don’t come back, I’ll try to bury you in a nicer spot.\"  \n\n\"If you serve the supernatural entity inside well, not only will you leave alive, but you’ll also get the mission item you want.\"  \n\nAs he spoke, the door behind him creaked open slightly.  \n\nCheng Fang quickly stood up and hurried toward the passageway, putting on an obsequious smile outside the room: \"Master, are you satisfied?\"  \n\nFrom the pitch-black room came a voice both alluring and languid: \"Inferior goods.\"  \n\n\"Keep screening and sending them in until I’m satisfied.\"  \n\n\"Understood, right away!\"  \n\nAs he spoke, Cheng Fang dragged out another shriveled corpse from the room and carefully closed the door.  \n\nPiling the withered body in the corner, he turned to Ji Yan and the other man: \"See? This is what happens if you don’t make it out.\"  \n\n\"And you’re unlucky—that entity’s desires are unusually high today.\"  \n\n\"Five have already been sent in, and it’s still not satisfied. Now it’s your turn.\"  \n\n\"Who’s going first?\"  \n\n\"Fuck! What kind of bullshit mission is this? It’s just walking to your death! Let me the hell out—I’m abandoning this mission!\"  \n\nBy now, Vest Man finally grasped just how twisted this mission was, his emotions boiling over.  \n\n\"Abandon? The moment you stepped through that door, the mission was locked in.\"  \n\n\"Once a mission starts, there’s no backing out. Whatever happens to players during the mission doesn’t count as breaking the apartment’s rules.\"  \n\nWiping blood from his hands, Cheng Fang smirked. \"It’s not necessarily hopeless. There’ve been successful cases before. Sure, that guy was nearly drained dry, but at least he left alive.\"  \n\nUnlike Vest Man, who was screaming and only thinking of escape, Ji Yan asked quietly, \"So, what exactly is that entity inside?\"  \n\n\"What kind of entity? I don’t know.\"  \n\n\"All I know is that female entity has bottomless desires every day. Men aren’t just her nourishment—they’re her cravings.\"  \n\n\"Isn’t that just a succubus?\"  \n\nVest Man broke out in a cold sweat.  \n\nCheng Fang sneered. \"A measly succubus would just wreck your kidneys.\"  \n\n\"The one in there? She’ll drain you dry—everything but your skin and bones!\"",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 4: How to Break the Deadlock? Stocking Up on Supplies  \n\nCheng Fang wanted to chat a bit more.  \n\nSuddenly, a cold, impatient voice echoed through the room.  \n\n\"Xiao Cheng, your efficiency has been slipping lately.\"  \n\n\"I’m considering whether to replace you with someone else.\"  \n\nHearing this, Cheng Fang—who had been laughing and joking just a second ago—instantly stiffened.  \n\n\"Master, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I’ll send him in right away!\"  \n\nWith that, he immediately dragged Vest Man toward the room.  \n\nVest Man struggled desperately, like livestock headed for slaughter, but it was futile. He was eventually thrown into the room by Cheng Fang, and the moment the door closed, silence fell.  \n\nCheng Fang walked over to Ji Yan and said, \"Don’t blame me. We’re all Players here—I just want to survive.\"  \n\n\"When I first entered this dungeon, I started off living under the same roof as that Female Supernatural Entity. No one was more desperate than me!\"  \n\nAs he spoke to Ji Yan, Cheng Fang began loading the dried-up corpses onto a cart, preparing to dispose of them.  \n\nJi Yan: \"And yet, you’ve survived until now?\"  \n\nHe couldn’t help but feel curious.  \n\nCheng Fang was a man too—why hadn’t the Female Supernatural Entity targeted him? Was it just because she needed someone to handle the corpses, allowing him to survive in this role?  \n\nThat seemed too flimsy. Anyone could do that.  \n\nThis Cheng Fang might know some strategy for dealing with that Female Supernatural Entity. Maybe he could find useful clues!  \n\n\"I know what you’re thinking.\"  \n\nCheng Fang saw right through Ji Yan’s thoughts and waved his hand dismissively.  \n\n\"Don’t fantasize. Living with that insatiable Female Supernatural Entity, the fact that I’ve survived until now isn’t because of some strategy—it’s pure dumb luck.\"  \n\nJi Yan frowned. \"Dumb luck?\"  \n\nCheng Fang suddenly grinned, his expression oddly proud. \"My Talent Trait is the most useless D-grade.\"  \n\n\"Honestly, in this dungeon, it gives me no advantage whatsoever. But for some reason, it works perfectly against that Female Supernatural Entity—even saved my life.\"  \n\n\"This Talent Trait is called [One Special Skill]. We’re both men—I don’t need to spell it out for you, right?\"  \n\n\"Even if my combat skills are lacking, my… hardware outperforms every other Player.\"  \n\n\"Do you know what 32 means? It’s Guinness World Record material!\"  \n\n\"Thanks to this… special skill, the Female Supernatural Entity couldn’t bring herself to drain me completely. She gave me this corpse-disposal job instead, letting me scrape by until now.\"  \n\n\"Sure, I have to deal with bodies and screen Players every day, but in this apartment, I’ve got it better than most.\"  \n\nJi Yan was rendered speechless.  \n\nTalent Traits really came in all shapes and sizes.  \n\n[One Special Skill]? Seriously?  \n\nWas that how this idiom was supposed to be interpreted?  \n\n\"Still, you’re the first one I’ve seen who’s this calm. Usually, the people sent here piss themselves by now.\"  \n\nJi Yan shook his head. \"Screaming won’t change anything.\"  \n\n\"If I die, I’ll just get sent to the next dungeon.\"  \n\n\"I’ve only been here for one day—haven’t even laid the groundwork. Dying now wouldn’t be much of a loss.\"  \n\n\"Hey, you’re pretty philosophical, huh?\"  \n\n\"Don’t worry—when your time comes, I’ll handle your corpse gently.\"  \n\nSeeing Ji Yan’s unyielding expression, Cheng Fang was somewhat impressed, even admiring.  \n\nJi Yan ignored the comment and glanced at the assortment of props on the metal table nearby. \"What are those?\"\n\n\"The props used to serve that Female Supernatural Entity—don’t be shocked, it’s exactly what you’re thinking.\"  \n\n\"When that Female Supernatural Entity gets in the mood, the things she does are downright perverse, enough to shatter your moral compass!\"  \n\nHonestly, even without Cheng Fang’s explanation, Ji Yan could roughly guess just by looking at the toys on the table.  \n\nWhips, chains, and silver needles were considered normal by comparison.\n\nThere were even knuckle dusters, electric batons, and other items that made his eyelids twitch violently.  \n\nJust imagining it sent chills down his spine.  \n\nBut at this moment, Ji Yan saw hope in those props.  \n\n\"Have these all been used before?\"  \n\n\"They were used on the last few unlucky souls. Can’t you see they’re still damp?\"  \n\nCheng Fang was puzzled by Ji Yan’s question—until the next second, when he saw Ji Yan grab the chains, pick up the props one by one, and examine them closely.  \n\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked, stunned.  \n\n\"Studying them.\"  \n\nCheng Fang choked.  \n\nHe watched as Ji Yan picked up item after item, not only caressing them meticulously but also with a gleam in his eyes.  \n\nEven his expression showed traces of excitement.  \n\nShaking his head, Cheng Fang couldn’t help but mutter, \"I thought that Female Supernatural Entity was twisted enough, but turns out there’s someone even worse!\"  \n\nJi Yan was indeed excited—for a good reason.  \n\nOn those props, he had successfully triggered his talent, [Omniscient Understanding].\n\nHidden information about that Female Supernatural Entity was being rapidly deciphered, one piece after another.  \n\nHidden information meant there had to be another way to deal with her!  \n\nAs Ji Yan swiftly browsed through the acquired intel, his expression gradually shifted into something… fascinating.  \n\nCreak.\n\nAt that moment, the door at the end of the corridor swung open again.  \n\n\"Already done?\"  \n\nCheng Fang was stunned—it hadn’t even been five minutes.  \n\nHe hurriedly dropped the corpse he was handling and rushed toward the door.  \n\nJust as he arrived, a shriveled body was tossed out.  \n\nIt was Vest Man!  \n\nNow, his entire body was emaciated to skin and bones, his skin wrinkled like parchment—yet he was still alive.  \n\nHis eyes were glazed over as he rasped, \"Spare me… please… there’s nothing left!\"  \n\nAt the same time, the Female Supernatural Entity’s trembling voice echoed from inside the room.  \n\n\"Still not enough.\"  \n\n\"Keep sending them in. I need more… nutrition.\"\n\nCheng Fang’s heart sank.  \n\nWhat the hell was wrong with her today?  \n\nSix had already been sent in, and not only was she unsatisfied—she was growing even more insatiable.  \n\nHis gaze shifted to the corner, where only Ji Yan remained. Even he started feeling a sense of impending doom.  \n\nWe’re screwed!\n\nAt this rate, she might not even spare a veteran like me!  \n\nJust then, Ji Yan set down the props and walked over on his own.  \n\n\"Send me in,\" he said.  \n\nCheng Fang was taken aback—this was the first time a Player had volunteered without coercion. \"You’re so eager, it’s throwing me off. Really in a hurry to die and move on to the next dungeon?\"  \n\nJi Yan replied, \"It’s not necessarily a death trap.\"  \n\n\"Just fulfill her demands, and it’ll be fine.\"  \n\nCheng Fang nudged Vest Man’s limp body with his foot. \"Hah? Didn’t you see this big guy get drained to skin and bones in under ten minutes? Where’s your confidence coming from with that scrawny frame?\"  \n\n\"That’s just because you weren’t up to the task.\"\n\n\"...\"  \n\n\"I’m 32 centimeters—how the hell am I not up to the task?!\"\n\nFaced with Cheng Fang's flushed anger, Ji Yan offered no response. He pushed open the door and stepped into the pitch-black room.  \n\nThrough his talent, he had gathered a wealth of hidden information about the Female Supernatural Entity, leading him to a bold conjecture.  \n\nIf this conjecture turned out to be wrong, his ashes might be scattered to the wind!  \n\nBut to survive, he had to take risks.  \n\nHe decided to gamble!  \n\nBang!\n\nThe door slammed shut, plunging the room into dimness.  \n\nScattered across the floor were numerous props—some even stained with blood, like ice picks and nail hammers. At first glance, it looked like a crime scene.  \n\nAs Ji Yan surveyed his surroundings, a brutal force suddenly struck him, flipping him onto the ground. A strange odor filled his nostrils as an exquisitely beautiful face loomed before him.  \n\n\"Why did they throw such trash in here?\"\n\nThe Female Supernatural Entity ran her fingers over Ji Yan’s body, her delicate face twisted in dissatisfaction.  \n\nMeanwhile, as they made physical contact, hidden information flooded Ji Yan’s vision.  \n\n[Charming Specter: Loves devouring the essence and flesh of men. Not only does it enhance her specter power, but absorbing their marrow also helps maintain her appearance. Men are their best nourishment.]\n\n[Congratulations! The Charming Specter before you happens to be in a state of frenzied, unfulfilled desire. So, how will you break this deadlock to survive?]\n\nReading the teasing hidden message, Ji Yan thought to himself—Since when did this F-Level Talent become so anthropomorphic?\n\nA sharp pain shot through him as the specter’s razor-sharp nails pierced his skin.  \n\nThe Charming Specter was utterly disgusted by Ji Yan’s frail physique.  \n\n\"If there are no good offerings left, then let Xiao Cheng come in. I’ll just have to make do with him—though I’d hate to waste my little stockpile!\"\n\nSighing, the specter’s eyes filled with regret.  \n\nOutside the room, Cheng Fang, who had been eavesdropping, turned deathly pale upon hearing those words. His world seemed to collapse.  \n\nDamn it!\n\nShe’s not even sparing a veteran like me? What’s gotten into this specter today? Her appetite is like a bottomless pit!\n\nJi Yan, with one hand hidden beneath him, suddenly spoke up:  \n\n\"How do you know I’m no good if you don’t try me?\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"I’m no worse than the guy outside. I’ve got a big treasure on me too—want to see?\"\n\nHearing this, the specter’s dazed gaze instinctively drifted downward.  \n\n\"Oh? I don’t see anything.\"\n\n\"Who said it was down there? It’s up here!\"\n\nThe moment the words left his mouth, the specter lifted her head—just as Ji Yan’s hidden hand shot out, gripping a nail hammer, and smashed it straight into her flawless face.  \n\nIn an instant—blood splattered everywhere.",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 5: Obtaining the Supernatural Artifact, Activating Enchantment  \n\nLike fragile porcelain, the Charming Specter’s cheek shattered as the sharp end of the nail hammer pierced through her face, embedding itself into the bone.  \n\nJi Yan didn’t pause for even a second. He yanked the hammer free and brought it down again and again on the Charming Specter’s face.  \n\nBlood quickly spread across the floor…  \n\nThe horrifying sounds made the scene look like a deranged killer mercilessly torturing an innocent young girl.  \n\nOnly after twenty brutal swings did he finally stop.  \n\nDrip.  \n\nWarm blood trickled from the hammer.  \n\nJi Yan panted, enduring the numbness and pain in his right hand as he stared at the Charming Specter lying on the ground, his expression tense.  \n\nBut his tension wasn’t because he feared whether the Charming Specter was dead or not.  \n\nThe weapon in his hand was just an ordinary tool.  \n\nAgainst a Supernatural Entity, it couldn’t deal any real damage…  \n\nThe so-called \"weapon\" was nothing more than a prop for the Charming Specter to \"play\" with her prey.  \n\nThe mangled, bloodied head emitted scorching white smoke as the Charming Specter slowly stood up, her terrifying wounds visibly healing before his eyes.  \n\nHer gaze was unreadable as she looked at Ji Yan. \"So this is your ‘big treasure’?\"  \n\nJi Yan nodded calmly. \"Yes.\"  \n\n\"How did it feel?\"  \n\nThe Charming Specter lightly brushed her fingers over the wounds on her face, which continued to emit wisps of white smoke like cracked porcelain.  \n\n\"Not bad, actually. Quite thrilling.\"  \n\n\"Surprisingly… I kind of like it.\"  \n\n\"But it’s still far from enough.\"  \n\nThe moment she finished speaking, the hammer was already swinging toward her face again, smashing her slender body to the ground. Ji Yan swiftly grabbed the electric saw from the table and pressed it against the Charming Specter’s body. The horrifying whirring of the saw, mixed with the sound of tearing flesh, formed a spine-chilling symphony.  \n\nNot an ounce of mercy was shown!  \n\nFrom the hidden clues he’d gathered outside, Ji Yan had already guessed—  \n\nThis Charming Specter had strong tendencies.  \n\nAnd she was the masochistic type.  \n\nPain would excite her, stimulating her pleasure!  \n\nEven she herself hadn’t realized it.  \n\nShe had frequently indulged in tormenting and draining her prey, but over time, her mind had grown numb, her cravings increasingly insatiable…  \n\nNo matter how twisted her methods became, she could never be satisfied.  \n\nUntil now—when Ji Yan reversed their roles, turning her into the prey. It was as if he had opened a brand-new door for her.  \n\nIt was a bold move, a gamble.  \n\nBut now, watching her drenched in blood, her cheeks flushed with ecstasy, Ji Yan knew—  \n\nHe had bet right!  \n\n……  \n\nOutside the room, Cheng Fang, who had been nervously preparing to enter the battlefield himself, now wore a puzzled expression.  \n\nHe pressed his ear against the door.  \n\nThe sounds of the merciless electric saw and the Charming Specter’s exhilarated, pleasure-filled screams made him think Ji Yan was the one being tortured.  \n\nA cold sweat broke out on his forehead.  \n\n\"This is too brutal.\"  \n\n\"May this brother never encounter a Charming Specter in his next dungeon… Rest in peace.\"  \n\nHe even felt a twinge of gratitude toward Ji Yan.  \n\nIf not for him, it would have been Cheng Fang in that room right now.  \n\nListening to the relentless roar of the saw, Cheng Fang turned away to fetch a larger container. He had a feeling Ji Yan wouldn’t be leaving the room in one piece—he’d have to be collected in fragments…\n\n...\n\nInside the room, the bloody scene continued unabated.  \n\nJi Yan swung the electric saw with all his might, but within five minutes, the teeth shattered, the chain snapped, and the saw was completely destroyed.  \n\nHe frowned.  \n\nThis thing’s so flimsy?\n\nSeeing the Charming Specter’s flushed, feverish expression—still insatiable—Ji Yan didn’t dare slack off. He quickly grabbed whatever props were scattered around and used everything he could to \"serve\" the entity.  \n\nAt some point, his hand closed around an unfamiliar object, and suddenly, an information panel popped up in his vision.  \n\n\"Ding! Congratulations, Player, for obtaining the hidden Supernatural Artifact—Satan’s Execution Tool. Successfully triggered [Talent].\"\n\n\"Grade: Rare.\"\n\n\"Details: A deranged serial killer who claimed to be Satan once used this to execute 10 innocent women in succession. The killer later vanished, but the bloodstained tool remained.\"\n\n\"Hidden Info: After landing 10 Skull-Crushing Strikes on a Supernatural Entity, the artifact will fully activate, attaching the curse effect [Soul Burn].\"\n\nSupernatural Artifacts were equipment that Players could obtain, varying widely in type—offensive, defensive, survival, support, and more.  \n\nTheir grades were classified as: Common, Rare, Uncommon, Collectible, and Epic.  \n\nSome high-grade Supernatural Artifacts were even more coveted than Talents!  \n\nJi Yan was stunned.  \n\nThis [F-Level Talent] can even uncover hidden info about artifacts?\n\nLooking down at the object in his hand, he saw it was a nail hammer. Unlike the other props, this one exuded a chilling aura, making his skin crawl just by holding it.  \n\nThis thing has killed ten people!\n\nHow much resentment must be clinging to it?\n\nSupernatural Artifacts could deal real damage to Supernatural Entities, so he worried—would this kill the Charming Specter?  \n\nWorry aside, his movements didn’t falter. Just as the Charming Specter was about to snap out of its euphoria, Ji Yan swung with all his strength, smashing the hammer into that crimson face.  \n\nThe impact shattered half its skull, the gaping wound spewing thick white smoke as the Charming Specter let out a piercing scream of agony.  \n\nJi Yan’s heart lurched—he braced for the entity’s furious retaliation—but then the scream twisted into a cry of ecstasy.  \n\n\"...\"  \n\nHis lips twitched. Seems I still underestimated how twisted this Female Supernatural Entity is. My worries were pointless.\n\nRealizing the artifact wouldn’t kill the Charming Specter—in fact, it worked too well—Ji Yan went all out, striking again and again.\n\nIf ten Skull-Crushing Strikes activated the enchantment, then there was no better target than this.  \n\nThis is the perfect damage-sponge dummy!\n\nAnd so, after over ten minutes of brutal head-smashing, the floor and walls were thoroughly painted red.  \n\nCovered in blood and brain matter, Ji Yan slumped against the wall, exhausted. The nail hammer in his hand, now \"tempered\" by the ordeal, gleamed a sinister crimson—the enchantment successfully activated.  \n\nJi Yan’s eyes lit up.  \n\nNow that I have a Supernatural Artifact, at least I’ve got some footing in this dungeon.\n\nI’m not just a pushover anymore.\n\nAs for the Charming Specter…  \n\nIt stood up yet again. Ji Yan was numb to it by now.  \n\nHe’d shattered its skull eleven times—the last strike even carried [Soul Burn]!\n\nThe Terrifying Black Flame directly incinerated half of her head. Any other Supernatural Entity would have been reduced to ashes by now.  \n\nYet, this Charming Specter, in the final enchanted critical strike, reached some kind of spiritual climax, deeply satisfied…  \n\nJi Yan even began to wonder if this Charming Specter was a boss-level entity in this dungeon.  \n\nWhat normal Supernatural Entity would use a Supernatural Artifact as their personal indulgence?  \n\nFortunately, after 11 consecutive skull-crushing strikes, the Charming Specter’s frenzied desires finally subsided…  \n\nShedding her tattered clothes, she changed into a fresh outfit. Her stunning face, now devoid of its earlier flush, was covered in a layer of frost—completely different from the entity she had been just a minute ago.  \n\nSitting on a chair, she crossed her long, proud legs, lit a slender cigarette, and casually tossed over a small bag.  \n\n\"What’s this?\"  \n\n\"A little extra tip.\"  \n\n\"Your service was excellent. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt this good.\"  \n\nThe Charming Specter exhaled smoke, speaking leisurely.  \n\n\"……\"  \n\nJi Yan’s expression twisted oddly. Why did he suddenly feel like he was selling himself?",

    "content": "第6章完成任务，原料炸裂\n\n在莫名其妙屈辱感下，纪言打开袋口，里面是一些常见的口粮。\n面包、压缩饼干、不知名肉干……\n虽然都是粗粮，但在诡异世界，这种人类食物已经算是奢侈品食物了。\n这个份量，纪言一周内暂时不用担心温饱问题了。\n“说吧，要借什么？”\n“血琵琶。”\n一听血琵琶，魅诡立即了然：“你是404那那死酒鬼的孩子。”\n“嗯，父亲腿疼的厉害，要我来这里求药。”\n“谁跟你说那是药？”\n“那个嗜酒如命的家伙，整天就惦记我这点酒，没想到连苦肉计都用出来了。”\n魅诡冷嘲，对那魇食诡十分厌恶。\n纪言闻言，皱眉不解：“他为什么不直接明说？”\n任务具备强制性，血琵琶是酒还是药，玩家都必须完成，花这些没必要的心思做什么？\n魅诡托腮轻笑：“防止你有其它心思。”\n“他就没想着你活着回来，因为你从一开始只是个交易品。”\n“我跟那家伙约定过，只要送一个孩子过来，我就赏他半瓶血琵琶。”\n换句话讲，这是一条单一供应链。\n404一旦刷新玩家，魇食诡就会借着任务，把玩家引到101，给魅诡充当补品。\n不仅各取所需。\n还不破坏公寓规则。\n纪言闻言，面色微沉。\n敢情这才是真正的局……\n魅诡将一瓶酱油大小的瓶子甩过来，纪言急忙接住：“按照交易，应该只给半瓶。”\n“但今天我心情很好，给你满瓶，好拿回去交差。”\n纪言盯着瓶中的液体，眼红暗黑，看着十分粘稠。\n他不禁好奇，这到底什么酒，能让那魇食诡这么馋？\n“好奇的话，你可以偷偷尝一口，但尝了之后，发生什么事可不怪我。”\n“而且，你绝对不会猜得到，这酒我是用什么酿制出来的～”\n听着魅诡那略带挑逗的声音，纪言莫名打了个颤。\n他不敢想，也没兴趣想。\n只想老老实实完成任务。\n把魇食诡灌死了最好！\n“我可以走了吗？”纪言开口，生怕这女诡太着迷于自己，强行把自己留在这里，变成她的固定需求品。\n魅诡的确是想。\n但游戏任务具备强制性，诡异作为npc并不能左右，违背也会受到惩罚。\n“走吧。”\n“不过，我还是蛮好奇，你是怎么发现我有这方面的倾向呢？”\n纪言轻咳两声，硬着头皮圆谎：“这种东西，不用明说。”\n“有时候一个眼神就看出来了。”\n魅诡一听，笑容异常灿烂风情：“看着挺老实，没想到玩的居然比我还变态呢？”\n“……”\n为了活命，纯情大男孩也好，S施虐变态也好，纪言都不在意，逢场作戏罢了。\n身后的房门缓缓打开，纪言刚转身，就传来魅诡意味深长的道别：“小弟弟，我们下次见。”\n纪言没回应，心道傻子还会再见。\n转身退出了不堪入目的房间。\n见纪言逃似的跑了，魅诡不紧不慢地掐灭烟头，抬起白皙的长腿。\n“摊上那个死酒鬼老爹，你跑不掉的。”\n“我吃定你了！”\n魅诡意犹未尽地舔了舔嘴角，轻抚脸颊修复的伤口，眼神迷离，渐渐回味……\n……\n房门打开，还想着把纪言清理出来的程方，拉着一个推车就屁颠过来了。\n然而，看到出来的是纪言后，他顿时傻眼了。\n“卧槽！你是人是诡？！”\n纪言反问：“你看我像诡吗？”\n看着纪言满是血污的衣物，程方站在原地，大脑一时间陷入了宕机。\n“你该不会，把那个女诡干掉了吧？”\n“也不对，不可能，你一定是钻了什么空子。”\n他清楚那魅诡有多恐怖，如果能杀，也不会有这么多玩家在她手里遭殃。\n纪言：“进去前我说过了，把那只诡伺候满足即可。”\n似乎是为了证明纪言的话，房间内传出魅诡的声音：“小程，把房间打扫干净。”\n“我去睡了。”\n程方连忙应了一句，这下子，看向纪言的眼神了完全变了。\n魅惑每次欲望退去，都会熟睡过去，往往一睡就是几天，这段时间，也是程方最安逸的时间。\n“没事的话，我先走了。”\n纪言拎着血琵琶，转身就要走。\n程方却拉住纪言，满眼都是崇拜之意：“哥，别急着走啊！能告诉我你到底发现了什么隐藏攻略吗？”\n“这样，我拿三天的口粮跟你换！”\n“五天！先坐下来慢慢谈！”\n对于固定在101的玩家，程方每天面对魅诡都提心吊胆。\n如果能找到制服魅诡的办法，那可就一劳永逸了！\n纪言自然不会把自己辛苦得来的办法透露出去。\n任何东西都会失去新鲜感，这魅诡说不定下次还要打交道，告诉了程方，这家伙赖以使用，那魅诡刚发现的新大陆很快就会麻木，下次必然不奏效。\n这是断自己后路。\n“没攻略，纯实力。”\n“我说了，武器好没用，火力要给足，不然32厘米的枪也是摆设。”\n丢下这句话，纪言转身就走。\n留下满脸滑稽，也不知信没信的程方……\n走出101房间，任务总算是完成了。\n纪言长松一口气，这要命的第一个游戏任务总算是曲折完成。\n没有多逗留，转身就往楼上奔去。\n很快，回到了404。\n刘艺桐和董褚还没有回来，纪言径直走进了魇食诡的房间。\n“该死的兔崽子，你还没出发？”\n魇食诡一见到纪言，面目顿时阴森起来。\n下意识就咬定纪言还没出门。\n按照他和魅诡的私下交易，纪言如果去了101，不可能活着回来。\n回来见他的，只会是魅诡命令程方送来的血琵琶。\n“父亲，药我已经拿到了。”\n将腰间的血琵琶摘下，纪言放置在桌子上。\n“你说什么？”魇食诡先是愣住，盯着那瓶艳红暗沉的液体。\n只是一眼，他就确信那就是魅诡的血琵琶。\n他不敢置信地看着纪言那毫发无损的身体，各种猜想浮上心头。\n这小子怎么活着回来的？\n“你怎么到手的？”\n“那姐姐很好说话，我说我爹腿烂的厉害，夜不能寐，她听后十分感动，就送我了。”\n听着纪言脸部红，心不躁的胡诌，魇食诡的脸瞬间就黑了。\n那女人会感动？\n这狗屁话，他死都不信！\n但在看到血琵琶之后，魇食诡大脑就被这东西占据，甚至没心思去想纪言这个交易品怎么活下来的。\n拧开木塞，便贪婪地灌入口中……\n很快，纪言嗅到了一股极其难闻的味道。\n那味道，腥的厉害！\n像酒又不像酒，怎么对魇食诡诱惑力这么大？\n“滚出去吧，别在这碍眼了！”\n魇食诡双眼开始飘忽，满是陶醉，对纪言不耐烦吐了一句。\n纵使纪言拿到了满瓶的血琵琶，依旧没有任何好脸色。\n在他眼里，这些玩家本身就是来伺候他的，说是孩子更像是奴隶，不开心就弄死换一批就是。\n纪言没说话，转身退出房间。\n关门的时候，听见了魇食诡那又爱又恨的声音。\n“那娘们下边的血，到底怎么酿制的，老子这辈子都没喝过这么美妙的酒！”\n纪言呛了一声。\n顿感一阵恶寒。\n淦！\n搞半天原材料是大姨妈血，这诡异世界的东西，还真是一样比一样炸裂。",
    "translatedContent": "Chapter 6: Mission Accomplished, Ingredients Exploded  \n\nUnder a vague sense of humiliation, Ji Yan opened the bag to find some common rations inside.  \n\nBread, compressed biscuits, unidentified jerky…  \n\nThough coarse, in the Eerie World, such human food was already considered a luxury.  \n\nWith this amount, Ji Yan wouldn’t have to worry about food for at least a week.  \n\n\"Speak. What do you want to borrow?\"  \n\n\"The Blood Pipa.\"  \n\nHearing this, the Charming Specter immediately understood. \"Ah, you’re that dead drunkard’s kid from Room 404.\"  \n\n\"Mn. My father’s legs are in terrible pain. He sent me here to beg for medicine.\"  \n\n\"Who told you it was medicine?\"  \n\n\"That alcohol-obsessed bastard is always eyeing my stash. Never thought he’d resort to such a bitter ruse.\"  \n\nThe Charming Specter sneered, her disdain for the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity palpable.  \n\nJi Yan frowned, puzzled. \"Why didn’t he just say it outright?\"  \n\nThe Mission was mandatory. Whether the Blood Pipa was wine or medicine, Players had to complete it. Why bother with these unnecessary schemes?  \n\nThe Charming Specter propped her chin on her hand, smiling faintly. \"To prevent you from getting other ideas.\"  \n\n\"He never expected you to return alive. Because from the start, you were just a bargaining chip.\"  \n\n\"I made a deal with him—send me a child, and I’d reward him with half a bottle of Blood Pipa.\"  \n\nIn other words, this was a one-way supply chain.  \n\nWhenever Room 404 spawned a new Player, the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity would use the Mission to lure them to Room 101, turning them into the Charming Specter’s nourishment.  \n\nMutually beneficial.  \n\nAnd without breaking the apartment’s rules.  \n\nJi Yan’s expression darkened.  \n\nSo this was the real trap all along…  \n\nThe Charming Specter tossed over a bottle the size of a soy sauce container. Ji Yan caught it hastily. \"By the deal, it should only be half a bottle.\"  \n\n\"But I’m in a good mood today. Take the full bottle back to settle your task.\"  \n\nJi Yan stared at the liquid inside—dark red, thick, and unsettlingly viscous.  \n\nHe couldn’t help but wonder: What kind of wine was this, to make the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity so desperate for it?  \n\n\"Curious? You could sneak a taste. But don’t blame me for what happens afterward.\"  \n\n\"And you’d never guess what I used to brew this wine~\"  \n\nHearing the Charming Specter’s teasing tone, Ji Yan shuddered involuntarily.  \n\nHe didn’t dare—nor care—to imagine.  \n\nHe just wanted to complete the Mission honestly.  \n\nIf the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity drank itself to death, even better!  \n\n\"Can I leave now?\" Ji Yan asked, fearing the Female Supernatural Entity might grow too attached and force him to stay as her permanent \"supply.\"  \n\nThe Charming Specter did consider it.  \n\nBut Missions were mandatory. As an NPC, even Supernatural Entities couldn’t interfere without facing Punishment.  \n\n\"Go on.\"  \n\n\"Though I am curious… how did you figure out my… preferences?\"  \n\nJi Yan coughed twice, forcing out a lie. \"Some things don’t need to be said.\"  \n\n\"Sometimes, a single glance is enough.\"  \n\nThe Charming Specter’s smile bloomed, radiant and alluring. \"You seem so innocent, yet you play even more twisted than I do?\"  \n\n\"……\"  \n\nTo survive, Ji Yan didn’t care whether he had to act like a pure-hearted boy or a sadistic freak. It was all just a performance.  \n\nAs the door behind him creaked open, the Charming Specter’s parting words followed him out, laden with implication:  \n\n\"See you next time, little brother.\"\n\nJi Yan didn't respond, thinking to himself that only fools would meet again.  \n\nHe turned and exited the revolting room.  \n\nSeeing Ji Yan flee as if escaping, the Charming Specter leisurely stubbed out her cigarette and lifted her pale, slender leg.  \n\n\"With that drunken bastard of a father you've got, you can't run away.\"  \n\n\"I've got my sights set on you!\"  \n\nThe Charming Specter licked her lips lingeringly, gently touching the healed wound on her cheek, her eyes hazy as she slowly savored the memory...  \n\n...  \n\nThe door opened, and Cheng Fang, who had been planning to clean up whatever remained of Ji Yan, came bustling over with a cart.  \n\nHowever, upon seeing Ji Yan step out, he was utterly dumbfounded.  \n\n\"Holy shit! Are you human or a supernatural entity?!\"  \n\nJi Yan countered, \"Do I look like a supernatural entity to you?\"  \n\nStaring at Ji Yan's bloodstained clothes, Cheng Fang stood frozen, his brain short-circuiting.  \n\n\"Don't tell me... you killed that Female Supernatural Entity?\"  \n\n\"No, that can't be. Impossible. You must've found some loophole.\"  \n\nHe knew exactly how terrifying the Charming Specter was. If she could be killed, so many players wouldn't have suffered at her hands.  \n\nJi Yan said, \"I told you before going in—just satisfy that supernatural entity, and you're good.\"  \n\nAs if to prove Ji Yan's words, the Charming Specter's voice came from inside the room:  \n\n\"Xiao Cheng, clean up the room.\"  \n\n\"I'm going to sleep.\"  \n\nCheng Fang hurriedly acknowledged, and now his gaze toward Ji Yan had completely changed.  \n\nEvery time the Charming Specter's desires subsided, she would fall into a deep sleep, often for days. This was also the most peaceful time for Cheng Fang.  \n\n\"If there's nothing else, I'll be going now,\" Ji Yan said, holding the Blood Pipa as he turned to leave.  \n\nBut Cheng Fang grabbed him, eyes full of admiration. \"Bro, don't rush off! Can you tell me what hidden strategy you actually discovered?\"  \n\n\"Here's the deal—I'll trade you three days' worth of rations!\"  \n\n\"Five days! Sit down and let's talk this through!\"  \n\nAs a player permanently stationed in Room 101, Cheng Fang lived in constant fear of the Charming Specter.  \n\nIf he could find a way to subdue her, it would be a permanent solution!  \n\nJi Yan naturally had no intention of sharing his hard-earned method.  \n\nEverything loses its novelty eventually. He might have to deal with the Charming Specter again, and if he told Cheng Fang, the guy would overuse it. The Charming Specter's newfound \"interest\" would quickly wear off, rendering the method useless next time.  \n\nThat would be cutting off his own escape route.  \n\n\"No strategy. Pure skill.\"  \n\n\"I told you—good weapons mean nothing if you don't bring enough firepower. A 32-centimeter gun is just for show otherwise.\"  \n\nWith that, Ji Yan turned and walked away, leaving Cheng Fang with a bewildered expression, unsure whether to believe him or not...  \n\nExiting Room 101, the mission was finally complete.  \n\nJi Yan let out a long sigh of relief—the first life-or-death game task had been tortuously accomplished.  \n\nWithout lingering, he immediately headed upstairs.  \n\nSoon, he returned to Room 404.  \n\nLiu Yitong and Dong Chu hadn't come back yet, so Ji Yan went straight into the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity's room.  \n\n\"Damn brat, you haven't even left yet?\"  \n\nThe moment the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity saw Ji Yan, its face twisted into a sinister glare.  \n\nInstinctively, it assumed Ji Yan hadn't set out.  \n\nBased on its secret deal with the Charming Specter, if Ji Yan had gone to Room 101, there was no way he'd return alive.  \n\nThe only thing that should have come back was the Blood Pipa, delivered by Cheng Fang under the Charming Specter's orders.  \n\n\"Father, I've already retrieved the medicine,\" Ji Yan said.\n\nJi Yan removed the Blood Pipa from his waist and placed it on the table.  \n\n\"What did you say?\" The Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity froze for a moment, staring at the bottle of dark crimson liquid.  \n\nWith just one glance, it was certain—this was the Charming Specter’s Blood Pipa.  \n\nIt stared at Ji Yan’s completely unharmed body in disbelief, countless speculations flooding its mind.  \n\nHow did this brat come back alive?\n\n\"How did you get it?\"  \n\n\"That sister was very kind. I told her my father’s legs were rotting badly, and he couldn’t sleep at night. She was so moved that she gave it to me.\"  \n\nListening to Ji Yan’s shameless, smooth-faced lie, the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity’s expression darkened instantly.  \n\nThat woman—moved?\n\nThis bullshit, it wouldn’t believe even in death!  \n\nBut after seeing the Blood Pipa, the Nightmare Devourer’s mind was completely consumed by it, leaving no room to question how Ji Yan, a mere bargaining chip, had survived.  \n\nTwisting open the wooden stopper, it greedily gulped the liquid down…  \n\nSoon, Ji Yan caught a whiff of an unbearably foul stench.  \n\nThe smell was nauseatingly pungent!  \n\nIt resembled wine, yet wasn’t wine—how could it be so enticing to the Nightmare Devourer?  \n\n\"Get out! Don’t stand there ruining my mood!\"  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer’s eyes grew hazy, brimming with intoxication, as it spat out the impatient order at Ji Yan.  \n\nEven though Ji Yan had delivered a full bottle of the Blood Pipa, it still showed him no kindness.  \n\nIn its eyes, these Players existed solely to serve it—more like slaves than children. If they displeased it, it could just kill them and replace them with a new batch.  \n\nJi Yan said nothing, turning to leave the room.  \n\nAs he closed the door, he heard the Nightmare Devourer’s voice, a mix of adoration and resentment.  \n\n\"That bitch’s menstrual blood—how the hell is it brewed? I’ve never tasted anything so divine in my life!\"  \n\nJi Yan choked.  \n\nA wave of disgust washed over him.  \n\nDamn it!\n\nSo the main ingredient was period blood? The things in this Eerie World just kept getting more and more outrageous.",

    "content": "第7章诡物面具，熄灯规则\n\n纪言一出来，脑海里就响起游戏播报音。\n“叮！恭喜玩家成功拿到血琵琶，完成C级任务。”\n“获得任务奖励：【剪刀手的面具】。”\n“等级：稀有。”\n“介绍：曾经一个叫爱德华的男人，为了给心爱的女孩复仇，他带上这块面具，每杀死一人，就将凶手的脸皮剪下缝合面具上，多么至死不渝的爱情不是么？”\n“能力：使用诡物，可增强5%感知能力。”\n“叮！天赋触发，获得诡物隐藏信息。”\n“隐藏操作：让面具吸吮使用者鲜血，可附带隐藏效果——玩家可替换为诡异剪刀手杀人魔身份。”\n“任务总结：玩家依旧并未获得父亲好感度，请再接再厉！”\n“又触发隐藏信息了。”\n纪言眼睛闪烁，这天赋简直太吃香了。\n这就像是一把枪落到不同的人手里，别人只能充当烧火棍。\n而他却把子弹打光，变成杀人器，把该有的价值使用出来！\n照这么看来，哪怕纪言得到低级的诡物，也能通过天赋，以另一种形式变相升级？\n至于那一句评级，纪言并不关心。\n那魇食诡就是一条冷血的蛇，哪怕你讨好一万次，他也觉得理所应当，纪言也没想着有好感。\n从工具栏里取出奖励的诡物，是一块小丑面具，惊悚的是，上面缝合着一张张满是血污的脸皮，让人有种在跟死人对视的感觉，十分瘆人。\n“怎么让面具吸收我的血？”\n纪言迟疑一下。\n将手指戳进了面具的嘴部。\n下一瞬间，猛地感觉到一阵刺痛。\n就像是被尖锐的东西刺了，但他把手指抽出，指尖溢出了鲜血。\n再看面具，就像活过来一般，上面的人皮蠕动，就像是一张张恐怖的鬼脸，痛苦地哀嚎！\n而在面具的边缘，居然长出了一根根森白的骨刺。\n整张面具，宛如赋予了生命。\n惊悚而怪谲！\n“这应该就算是激活了吧？”\n纪言不确定。\n但他想戴上去试试效果的时候，后方传来了惊愕的声音。\n“你是没出发呢，还是又跑了回来？”\n纪言转身，看见了董褚那张一副看笑话的嘴脸。\n董褚还想调侃两句，却看见了纪言手中的人皮面具，神色微微愣住。\n纪言面无表情收起诡物，也没搭理董褚，转身就朝着客厅走去。\n几次被甩脸色，让董褚眉头皱起，愈发不悦。\n客厅里，刘艺桐也回来了。\n“你怎么回来了？”她看见纪言，同样以为纪言任务没完成就回来了。\n“任务完成了，不会来做什么？”纪言坐下，拿出魅诡那里得来的粗粮。\n看到粗粮的一刹那，刘艺桐和董褚都信了，可101那个房间出了名的死亡关卡，这才过去三个小时，他是怎么完成的？\n撕开压缩饼干的包装，纪言简单说道：“走了狗屎运，那诡看我长得讨喜，就给了我半瓶血琵琶。”\n两人对视一眼，也不知信没信。\n但不管怎样，纪言还活蹦乱跳吃着食物，就是通关了。\n一听“走狗屎运”，董褚整张脸难看的跟吃了苍蝇一样。\n“艹！这狗屎运老子怎么没有？”\n他的任务是帮奶奶诡弄到一副假牙。\n按照任务指引，去了6楼去找，不仅没有找到，还差点被6楼的诡异住户抓去做成人体标本。\n最后任务失败，奶奶诡黑化，摘掉了董褚一颗眼珠子，当作惩罚，\n不说纪言还没发现，这家伙变成了独眼龙。\n看着还怪滑稽的。\n纪言对这个家伙没什么好感，懒得听他的抱怨，继续吃着手里的食物。\n刘艺桐因为完成了任务，也得到了今日份的食物，但相对于纪言手里，自然寒酸许多。\n只有董褚最难受，不仅没有今日份食物，还恶化了“诡异奶奶”的关系。\n他之所以能在404小屋活到现在，就是在奶奶身上，得到了不少好感度，才没被扮演父亲的魇食诡针对。\n魇食诡的任务关卡，虽然玩家死亡率最高。\n但在小屋三只诡里，却是最弱的。\n因此在妈妈和奶奶两只诡异庇护下，魇食诡才没对董褚和刘艺桐下手，却始终虎视眈眈着……\n没了一只眼睛的董褚，已经有了强烈的危机感。\n没有食物，董褚只能拿出昨天留下来的食物，或许是受到诡异环境的影响，那本就黏糊的食物，表面更是覆盖了一层黑毛。\n只是吃两口，董褚就吐了出来。\n然后，他扭头看向纪言手里的饼干，肚子里的馋虫剧烈抗议着。\n轻咳两声，他刚想开口，纪言就直接打断道：“别看了，你老玩家这么厉害，哪看的上我手里的这些粗粮？”\n纪言用着早上董褚那看待自己的眼神，回看对方。\n董褚脸色一黑。\n一旁的刘艺桐差点没忍住笑。\n“给我一块饼干，我可以透露你妈妈和奶奶那两只诡异的信息。”\n“一块压缩饼干，换一条救命线索，这划算买卖够赚了吧？”\n“你最好考虑快点，不然我等下反悔了。”\n董褚继续压低姿态。\n他必须吃东西，不仅仅是饿了，也是为了明天的状态。\n诡异世界是个游戏化的世界，每天玩家都要摄取有营养的食物，否则第二天各项体能数值都会显著下降。\n没了一只眼睛，视力本就下降，身体机能不能再下降。\n“那你反悔呗，我又没拦着你。”\n纪言将最后一点饼干放入口中。\n董褚嘴角抽了抽，冷笑出声：“果然是小白，才来第一天，根本就不知道信息差的重要性。”\n“你今天踩了狗屎运，可不是每天都踩到。”\n纪言喝了口水，耸耸肩膀：“明天的事明天再说。”\n“难道你知道明天要死，今天就要毙了自己吗？”\n“行，你非要逞英雄，那我不拦你，明天别来求我就行，在这个屋里，没人比我了解那三只诡。”\n“天快黑了，刘大美女赶紧回房间吧，别被这倒霉鬼传染了晦气！”\n扫了眼刘艺桐，董褚转身回到了自己的房间。\n刘艺桐微微颦眉，但没说什么，似乎也不喜欢董褚这性子。\n纪言有些好笑。\n有了【全知全解】这个天赋，他最不愁的就是诡异信息，指不定哪天，董褚还要来求他。\n拧上瓶盖，扭头对刘艺桐说道：“我还是第一次见，求别人给口吃的，还倒反天罡要别人来求他的。”\n“他一直这么逆天的吗？”\n刘艺桐摇摇头，有些无奈说道：“他这个人就是这样。”\n“比我早两天进入这个副本，在404这个屋里头每个人他都要压一头。”\n“你还是别得罪他了，毕竟第一天来，论装备经验，你都是要吃亏的。”\n纪言没有说话，他不喜欢惹是生非，但如果有人非要咬他一口，他也不会手软。\n“这栋公寓会在九点后熄灯，灯灭之后，无论你在做什么，都不要走出自己的房间。”\n“十二点之后，必须要躺在床上就寝了。”\n见公寓外的浓雾天色逐渐暗沉，刘艺桐给纪言讲解了一下夜晚的公寓规则。\n纪言挑眉：“夜晚有什么危险？”\n“夜晚的公寓，会刷新许多恐怖的未知npc，它们能走进房屋内，玩家一旦碰到，会被强制性触发地狱难度的任务。”\n“有的失控npc甚至能直接对玩家出手。”\n“之前就有一个玩家，睡到半夜突然醒来，下意识就去开门上了厕所，第二天等我们醒来，马桶给他的皮肤碎片堵死了……”\n“有人说，深夜刷新的npc，能爆出【珍藏】级装备，但哪个蠢蛋愿意拿自己的命去赌呢？”\n听完刘艺桐的提醒，纪言点了点头。\n他对深夜的公寓也不感兴趣，白天的任务难度，都已经整的他够呛了。\n在刘艺桐回房间时，纪言将一块面包递给了她。\n刘艺桐疑惑。\n纪言只有说道：“谢谢。”\n不管怎样，刘艺桐给自己讲解了这么多副本信息，多少表示一些，他也不喜欢欠人情，现在刘艺桐食物窘迫，一块面包虽然不多，但也是救命粮。\n刘艺桐明白什么意思，她笑了笑，忍不住内涵董褚。\n“所以我就说嘛，与其得罪一个人，不如顺手帮一个人，百利无一害。”",

Congratulations, Player, for successfully obtaining the Blood Pipa and completing the C-grade task.\"\n\n\"Task reward acquired: [Scissorhands' Mask].\"\n\n\"Grade: Rare.\"\n\n\"Description: Once, a man named Edward wore this mask to avenge his beloved girl. With each person he killed, he skinned their faces and stitched them onto the mask. What undying love, isn’t it?\"\n\n\"Ability: When using this Supernatural Artifact, perception increases by 5%.\"\n\n\"Ding! Talent triggered. Hidden Information about the Supernatural Artifact revealed.\"\n\n\"Hidden Operation: Let the mask suck the user’s blood to activate a concealed effect—the Player can assume the identity of the Supernatural Entity 'Scissorhands Murderer.'\"\n\n\"Task Summary: The Player still hasn’t gained favor with Father. Keep trying!\"\n\n\"Another hidden info trigger,\" Ji Yan murmured, his eyes gleaming. This talent was simply too advantageous.  \n\nIt was like a gun falling into different hands—others could only use it as a fire poker, but he could empty the entire magazine, turning it into a killing tool and maximizing its potential!  \n\nIf this was the case, even if Ji Yan obtained low-grade Supernatural Artifacts, his talent could indirectly upgrade them in another form, right?  \n\nAs for the remark about \"Father’s favor,\" Ji Yan couldn’t care less.  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity was nothing but a cold-blooded snake. Even if you pleased it ten thousand times, it would still take it for granted. Ji Yan had no intention of currying favor anyway.  \n\nHe retrieved the rewarded Supernatural Artifact from his inventory—a clown mask. What sent chills down his spine were the bloodstained faces stitched onto it, giving the eerie sensation of locking eyes with the dead.  \n\n\"How do I make the mask absorb my blood?\"  \n\nJi Yan hesitated for a moment before pressing his finger into the mask’s mouth.  \n\nThe next instant, a sharp sting shot through him, as if something had pierced him. When he pulled his finger out, blood welled from the tip.  \n\nThe mask seemed to come alive—the stitched faces writhed like tormented ghosts, howling in agony!  \n\nAlong the mask’s edges, bone-white spikes sprouted, as if the entire thing had been granted life.  \n\nHorrifying and grotesque!  \n\n\"Does this count as activating it?\"  \n\nJi Yan wasn’t sure, but just as he was about to try wearing it, a startled voice called out from behind.  \n\n\"Did you not leave, or did you run back already?\"  \n\nTurning around, Ji Yan saw Dong Chu’s mocking face.  \n\nDong Chu was about to taunt him further when his eyes landed on the flesh mask in Ji Yan’s hand, freezing momentarily.  \n\nExpressionless, Ji Yan stowed the Supernatural Artifact away and ignored Dong Chu, heading straight for the living room.  \n\nBeing brushed off repeatedly made Dong Chu’s frown deepen, his displeasure growing.  \n\nIn the living room, Liu Yitong had also returned.  \n\n\"Why are you back?\" she asked, assuming Ji Yan had returned without completing his task.  \n\n\"The task’s done. Why wouldn’t I come back?\" Ji Yan sat down and took out the coarse food he’d obtained from the Charming Specter.  \n\nAt the sight of the food, both Liu Yitong and Dong Chu believed him. But Room 101 was infamous as a death trap—how had he completed it in just three hours?\n\nTearing open the package of compressed biscuits, Ji Yan said simply, \"Got lucky. That supernatural entity found me likable and gave me half a bottle of the Blood Pipa.\"  \n\nThe two exchanged glances, unsure whether to believe him.  \n\nBut regardless, the fact that Ji Yan was alive and well, munching on food, meant he had passed the trial.  \n\nHearing the words \"got lucky,\" Dong Chu's face twisted as if he'd swallowed a fly.  \n\n\"Damn it! Why didn’t I get that kind of luck?\"  \n\nHis mission had been to obtain a set of false teeth for the Grandmother Supernatural Entity.  \n\nFollowing the task’s instructions, he went to the 6th floor to search but found nothing—instead, he nearly got captured by the eerie residents there and turned into a human specimen.  \n\nIn the end, he failed the mission, causing the Grandmother Supernatural Entity to turn hostile. As punishment, she plucked out one of Dong Chu’s eyeballs.  \n\nJi Yan hadn’t noticed before, but now it was clear—the guy had become a one-eyed man.  \n\nIt looked rather ridiculous.  \n\nJi Yan had no goodwill toward this guy and couldn’t be bothered to listen to his complaints, so he kept eating.  \n\nLiu Yitong, having completed her own mission, had also received today’s food ration, though it was far more meager compared to what Ji Yan had.  \n\nOnly Dong Chu was left in the worst state—not only did he have no food for the day, but his relationship with the \"Grandmother Supernatural Entity\" had also deteriorated.  \n\nThe reason he had survived this long in Dwelling 404 was because he had earned enough favor with the grandmother, shielding him from being targeted by the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity, who played the role of the father.  \n\nThough the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity’s missions had the highest Player mortality rate,  \n\namong the three supernatural entities in the dwelling, it was actually the weakest.  \n\nThus, under the protection of the mother and grandmother supernatural entities, the Nightmare Devourer had refrained from attacking Dong Chu and Liu Yitong—though it had always watched them with predatory intent.  \n\nNow missing an eye, Dong Chu felt a growing sense of crisis.  \n\nWith no food, he could only pull out yesterday’s leftovers. Perhaps due to the eerie environment’s influence, the already mushy food had grown a layer of black mold.  \n\nAfter just two bites, Dong Chu spat it out.  \n\nThen, he turned his gaze toward the biscuits in Ji Yan’s hand, his stomach growling in protest.  \n\nClearing his throat, he was about to speak when Ji Yan cut him off.  \n\n\"Don’t even look. A seasoned Player like you wouldn’t stoop to wanting my humble rations, right?\"  \n\nJi Yan shot him the same condescending look Dong Chu had given him that morning.  \n\nDong Chu’s face darkened.  \n\nLiu Yitong, standing nearby, barely stifled a laugh.  \n\n\"Give me one biscuit, and I’ll tell you some crucial info about the mother and grandmother supernatural entities.\"  \n\n\"One compressed biscuit in exchange for a life-saving clue—that’s a damn good deal, isn’t it?\"  \n\n\"You’d better decide fast, or I might change my mind.\"  \n\nDong Chu continued to lower his stance.  \n\nHe needed to eat—not just because he was hungry, but to maintain his condition for tomorrow.  \n\nThe Eerie World operated like a game—Players had to consume nutritious food daily, or their physical stats would drop significantly the next day.  \n\nAlready down one eye, his vision had worsened. He couldn’t afford to let his physical abilities deteriorate further.  \n\n\"Then go ahead and change your mind. I’m not stopping you.\"  \n\nJi Yan popped the last bit of biscuit into his mouth.  \n\nDong Chu’s lips twitched before he let out a cold laugh.  \n\n\"Typical newbie. Just arrived today and already clueless about the importance of the Information Gap.\"  \n\n\"You got lucky today, but that won’t happen every time.\"  \n\nJi Yan took a sip of water and shrugged.  \n\n\"Tomorrow’s problems are for tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Would you kill yourself today just because you know you’ll die tomorrow?\"  \n\n\"Fine, if you insist on playing the hero, I won’t stop you. Just don’t come begging for my help tomorrow. In this apartment, no one understands those three Supernatural Entities better than me.\"  \n\n\"It’s getting dark. Hurry back to your room, Liu the Beauty, before this jinx rubs his bad luck off on you!\"  \n\nAfter shooting Liu Yitong a glance, Dong Chu turned and retreated to his room.  \n\nLiu Yitong frowned slightly but said nothing, clearly disliking Dong Chu’s attitude.  \n\nJi Yan found it amusing.  \n\nWith his Omniscient Understanding talent, the last thing he worried about was information on Supernatural Entities. Who knew? Maybe one day, Dong Chu would be the one begging him.\n\nTwisting the cap back on his bottle, he turned to Liu Yitong. \"First time I’ve seen someone beg for food and then have the audacity to demand others beg him instead.\"\n\n\"Is he always this insufferable?\"  \n\nLiu Yitong shook her head helplessly. \"That’s just how he is.\"  \n\n\"He entered this instance two days before me, and in this 404 apartment, he always has to dominate everyone.\"  \n\n\"You’d better not provoke him. Since it’s your first day here, you’re at a disadvantage in terms of gear and experience.\"  \n\nJi Yan stayed silent. He didn’t like stirring up trouble, but if someone insisted on biting him, he wouldn’t hold back either.  \n\n\"This apartment’s lights go out after 9 PM. Once they’re off, no matter what you’re doing, don’t leave your room.\"  \n\n\"After midnight, you must be in bed.\"\n\nAs the thick fog outside darkened, Liu Yitong explained the apartment’s nighttime rules to Ji Yan.  \n\nJi Yan raised an eyebrow. \"What’s the danger at night?\"  \n\n\"At night, the apartment spawns many terrifying unknown NPCs. They can enter the rooms, and if a Player encounters them, they’ll be forced into a hell-difficulty Mission.\"\n\n\"Some rogue NPCs can even attack Players directly.\"  \n\n\"Once, a Player woke up in the middle of the night, instinctively went to the bathroom, and by the next morning, the toilet was clogged with his… skin fragments.\"  \n\n\"Some say the NPCs that spawn late at night can drop Collector’s Grade gear, but what idiot would gamble their life for that?\"\n\nAfter listening to Liu Yitong’s warnings, Ji Yan nodded.  \n\nHe wasn’t interested in the nighttime apartment either—the daytime Missions were already tough enough.\n\nAs Liu Yitong turned to leave, Ji Yan handed her a piece of bread.  \n\nShe looked puzzled.  \n\nJi Yan simply said, \"Thanks.\"  \n\nRegardless, Liu Yitong had shared a lot of valuable information about the instance. He didn’t like owing favors, and since she was short on food, a piece of bread—though small—was still lifesaving.  \n\nUnderstanding his meaning, Liu Yitong smiled and couldn’t resist taking a jab at Dong Chu.  \n\n\"That’s why I always say—instead of making an enemy, it’s better to lend a hand. No downsides, only benefits.\"",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 8: Midnight Knocking, a Familiar Scent  \n\nNight fell swiftly.  \n\nDarkness seeped into Room 404 like ink.  \n\nFollowing Liu Yitong’s advice, Ji Yan obediently lay down and fell asleep before midnight.  \n\nPerhaps due to exhaustion, he drifted into a deep slumber the moment his head hit the pillow.  \n\nBut in the middle of the night, Ji Yan was roused by a faint knocking sound.  \n\nSomeone was knocking on his door.  \n\n\"Ji Yan… Ji Yan, are you asleep?\"  \n\n\"If you can hear me, open the door quickly! Don’t stay in bed—those three Supernatural Entities are about to assign Missions again!\"  \n\n\"You need to come out now. If you miss the Mission, something terrible will happen!\"  \n\nThe voice belonged to Liu Yitong, laced with urgency yet hushed, as if afraid of being overheard.  \n\nJi Yan listened, rolled over, and went back to sleep.  \n\nHe had no idea what was outside his door, but it clearly had the ability to mimic a Player’s voice.  \n\nThe bait was just too clumsy.  \n\nEven if it really were Liu Yitong, he wouldn’t get up to open the door. As long as Players stayed in bed after lights-out, no Supernatural Entity could touch them.  \n\nThe \"Liu Yitong\" outside grew increasingly frantic when Ji Yan didn’t respond, the voice turning shrill and grating.  \n\nThen came the spine-chilling sound of nails scraping against the door…  \n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Ji Yan heard the sound of a door opening.  \n\nHe opened his eyes.  \n\nThe noise came from next door—Dong Chu’s room.  \n\nWhy would he open his door? He should know how dangerous the apartment was at night…  \n\nThough puzzled, Ji Yan heard nothing else unusual after the door opened.  \n\nSoon, he fell back into a deep sleep…  \n\nAt six the next morning, the pendulum clock in the living room chimed.  \n\nJi Yan woke up on time to find Liu Yitong and Dong Chu already seated in the living room, waiting for the day’s Mission.  \n\nPerhaps from hunger, Dong Chu looked haggard—dark circles under his eyes, his hair greasy and disheveled.  \n\nJi Yan glanced at him, and Dong Chu sneered, \"What? Do I have words written on my face?\"  \n\nLiu Yitong, in better spirits, asked Ji Yan, \"How was your first night sleeping in the dungeon?\"  \n\n\"Did anything happen last night?\"  \n\nJi Yan replied, \"Last night, I heard you calling for me outside my door, sounding like the room was on fire.\"  \n\nLiu Yitong’s expression shifted. \"That’s just one of the Supernatural Entities’ tricks. They’ll mimic any sound to get you to open the door.\"  \n\n\"One night, I even heard my dead sister begging for help.\"  \n\n\"I was half-asleep and almost thought it was a dream—I nearly opened the door!\"  \n\n\"You weren’t affected, were you?\"  \n\nJi Yan shrugged. \"I treated it as a lullaby and went back to sleep.\"  \n\n\"...\"  \n\n\"And,\" Ji Yan added, glancing at Dong Chu, \"I also heard a door open next door.\"  \n\nDong Chu scowled. \"You think I’d open the door if I wanted to live?\"  \n\nJi Yan didn’t respond, but he caught a faint, strange scent lingering on Dong Chu.  \n\nAnd for some reason, it felt oddly familiar…  \n\nJust then, the clock chimed again—the day’s Mission assignments were about to begin.  \n\nThe three hurried into the corridor, facing the three Supernatural Entity rooms.\n\nThe first summons came from the Grandmother Supernatural Entity's room: \"Good granddaughter, today I've knitted a sweater for you. You'll love it! Come in and try it on for me!\"  \n\nThe first one called was Liu Yitong.  \n\nHearing it was the Grandmother, she let out a sigh of relief.  \n\nIn this house, the Grandmother had the highest favorability toward her. Upon hearing the keyword \"knitted sweater,\" she guessed that today's mission would be of little difficulty—instead, it would further boost her favorability.  \n\nNext, a voice came from the Mother Supernatural Entity's room: \"Little Dong, Mommy’s coughing badly today. Come in and see what’s wrong with me.\"  \n\nDong Chu’s expression brightened slightly upon hearing this.  \n\nAmong the rooms, the Mother had the fewest danger zones. As long as he performed steadily without any mishaps, he could usually complete the mission without issue, and food wouldn’t be lacking.  \n\nWatching the two enter their respective Supernatural Entities' rooms, leaving Ji Yan alone in the hallway, a bad premonition crept over him.  \n\nDon’t tell me it’s…\n\nSure enough, the next second, the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity's voice rang out, laced with mockery.  \n\n\"Good son, come in quickly! Today, Daddy’s going to spoil you alone again!\"  \n\n\"...Damn it, why is it still this one?\" Ji Yan cursed inwardly. Has this damn thing really latched onto me?\n\nWasn’t it supposed to be random? Is my luck really this cursed?\n\nNo choice. Ji Yan steeled himself and stepped into that filthy room once more.  \n\nPerhaps having tasted the sweetness of a full bottle of Blood Pipa yesterday, the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity assigned him the same task as before.  \n\nIf the mission was the same, then it shouldn’t be too difficult.  \n\nBut as Ji Yan was about to leave, the entity tossed him a glass bottle. \"Use this one—and fill it to the brim!\"  \n\nLooking at the bottle, noticeably larger than yesterday’s, Ji Yan frowned.  \n\nThis greedy bastard. Next time, will it demand a whole barrel?\n\nJi Yan didn’t linger. He acknowledged the order and turned to leave, but as he stepped out, he caught a glint of amusement in the Nightmare Devourer’s eyes…  \n\nIt gave him an uneasy feeling.  \n\nExiting the room, the mission panel popped up immediately.  \n\nDing! Congratulations, Player, for triggering the daily mission. Please proceed to Room 101 to retrieve the [Blood Pipa] personally brewed by the Charming Specter and fill the given bottle. Mission rank: C-grade.\n\n\"If the mission’s the same, then the Nightmare Devourer shouldn’t be playing any tricks.\"  \n\nJi Yan muttered to himself, inspecting the bottle once more to confirm it was safe.  \n\nA short while later, Liu Yitong and Dong Chu also emerged from their rooms.  \n\nBoth of their missions were rated D-grade. Dong Chu was tasked with finding cough medicine for the Mother, while Liu Yitong’s was even simpler—wear the festive sweater knitted by the Grandmother and have the tailor neighbor downstairs adjust it for a proper fit.  \n\nWhat’s more, the red sweater turned out to be a [Supernatural Artifact], capable of blocking 20 points of damage from Supernatural Entities.  \n\nThe other two were speechless.  \n\nIs this supposed to be a difficult mission or a welfare handout?\n\nClearly, once favorability was high enough, not only did the difficulty drop, but they’d occasionally receive bonus equipment.  \n\nFor some reason, the Grandmother Supernatural Entity had a particular fondness for female players—especially fair-skinned ones like Liu Yitong.  \n\nLiu Yitong happily stroked the sweater, then remembered Ji Yan’s task. \"By the way, what’s your mission today?\"\n\n\"How unlucky, being assigned to the Father Supernatural Entity's room two days in a row.\"  \n\n\"Same as yesterday, but the amount has increased.\" Ji Yan raised the wine bottle in his hand.  \n\n\"Then you’ll have to go to Room 101 again?\" Liu Yitong paused in surprise.  \n\n\"Hah, didn’t someone say yesterday that dog luck can strike twice? What’s there to worry about?\"  \n\n\"Who knows, maybe today’s performance will be even better, and even the tough nut like the Father Supernatural Entity will be conquered?\"  \n\nDong Chu sneered a few words before brushing past Ji Yan to complete his mission.  \n\nBut at that moment, Ji Yan’s expression shifted.  \n\nAs Dong Chu passed by, the scent on him grew stronger—familiar.  \n\nWasn’t this the same smell from the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity’s room?  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity had specifically called for Ji Yan two days in a row. There was no reason for Dong Chu to interact with it.  \n\nJi Yan suddenly recalled the sound of the door opening last night and the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity’s odd look when it closed the door. His brows furrowed slightly...  \n\n\"Don’t mind him. That’s just how he talks.\"  \n\n\"Good luck again today. Don’t give up.\"  \n\nSeeing Ji Yan’s strange expression, Liu Yitong assumed his morale had been affected and comforted him before leaving to complete her mission.  \n\nAfter the two left, Ji Yan stared at the unremarkable wine bottle in his hand, lost in thought. He carefully ran his hands over every inch of the bottle.  \n\nThen, his [Talent] was actually triggered, and a [Hidden Information Panel] popped up.\n\n\"Supernatural Artifact: Artist's Wine Bottle.\"\n\n\"Effect: Any liquid poured into the bottle will transform into a 90% effective anesthetic.\"\n\n\"Grade: Common.\"\n\n\"Description: A life-obsessed artist who loved using wine bottles laced with anesthetic to intoxicate his prey. These prey eventually became so-called 'artworks' under his blade. Isn’t life just beautiful…\"\n\nJi Yan’s frown deepened.  \n\nThis bottle was a [Supernatural Artifact]?\n\nCould it be Dong Chu’s? Why was it in the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity’s possession, only to be handed to him?  \n\nThe bottle only revealed this much hidden information, but Ji Yan wasn’t satisfied. His gut told him there was likely an unknown secret here.  \n\nIn a place like the [Eerie World], he couldn’t afford to be careless.\n\nHe wanted to enter Dong Chu’s room to uncover more hidden information, but the door was locked tight.  \n\nAfter a moment of thought, Ji Yan suddenly turned his gaze to the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity’s door handle. If Dong Chu had entered that room last night, then…  \n\nJi Yan reached out and gripped the handle. The next second, another [Hidden Information Panel] appeared...",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 9: Reunion with the Charming Specter, the Girl on the 7th Floor  \n\n\"Last night, he opened the door and entered his father's room, where a human and a Supernatural Entity struck an unknown deal.\"  \n\n\"Guess why this Supernatural Artifact, the wine bottle, ended up in your hands?\"  \n\n\"You’ve already unknowingly fallen into a no-win situation. Whether you complete the mission or not, you’ll die. So, how will you break free?\"  \n\nStaring at the triggered information panel, Ji Yan’s expression darkened.  \n\nSure enough, Dong Chu was setting him up—all because of yesterday’s petty argument?  \n\nJi Yan doubted it. That guy was probably using him to bargain with the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity for some benefit.  \n\nAs for the nature of this dead end, Ji Yan had already pieced it together.  \n\nIf he used this bottle to hold the Blood Pipa, the contents would inevitably spoil, causing the mission to fail and giving the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity an excuse to punish him.  \n\nBut if he used a different bottle, he’d still violate the mission rules, giving the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity another reason to strike.  \n\nEither way, the mission would fail—a true no-win scenario.  \n\nSo how could he break free?  \n\nThe Hidden Information was cryptic, but it also hinted that a solution existed.  \n\nJi Yan pondered for a moment.  \n\nSuddenly, his brow furrowed. No matter how he thought about it, there was only one reckless, high-risk option.  \n\nBut before acting, he needed to consult another resident.  \n\nClutching the wine bottle, Ji Yan left Room 404.  \n\n---  \n\nSoon, Ji Yan returned to the first floor of the apartment and knocked on Room 101’s door.  \n\nThe door opened, revealing Cheng Fang’s head.  \n\nHe froze at the sight of Ji Yan. \"Seriously? You again?\"  \n\n\"Bro, are you addicted to grinding my Charming Specter’s quests?\"  \n\nJi Yan sighed. \"No choice. I don’t want to be here either—my body can’t take it.\"  \n\nCheng Fang glanced at his own physique and gave a thumbs-up. \"Respect!\"  \n\nOnce inside, Ji Yan immediately shed his coat and rolled up his sleeves, looking ready for an all-out battle.  \n\nCheng Fang recalled yesterday’s cleanup—blood and skin fragments everywhere—and broke into a cold sweat.  \n\nJust how twisted were these two?  \n\n\"Master, yesterday’s guest… is back,\" Cheng Fang called cautiously from the doorway.  \n\n\"Let him in! I’ve been wondering when he’d return!\"  \n\nThe Charming Specter’s delighted voice echoed from inside.  \n\nCheng Fang glanced back at Ji Yan, who wasted no time, pulling out the Murderer’s Nail Hammer and stepping into the room.  \n\nSoon, agonized yet euphoric cries filled the air. Cheng Fang shook his head and returned to the living room to munch on his steamed bun. \"Too brutal.\"  \n\n---  \n\nPerhaps fueled by frustration over his predicament, Ji Yan unleashed his pent-up rage on the Charming Specter with unprecedented ferocity—far more savage than yesterday, yet it only deepened her obsession.  \n\nRoughly half an hour later.  \n\nExhausted, Ji Yan lay sprawled on the blood-soaked floor. Beside him, the Charming Specter, her body riddled with horrific wounds, slowly dressed her mangled form.  \n\nHer face radiated post-climax satisfaction as she eyed Ji Yan in surprise. \"You were even wilder today than yesterday.\"\n\n\"It seems your addiction runs deeper than mine. How about I dig you out from that dead drunkard's grasp and have you take Xiao Cheng's place?\"  \n\n\"You're such a treasure, far better than that kid's 32 cm.\"  \n\nThe Charming Specter's slender fingers caressed the Supernatural Nail Hammer, now smeared with her own hair and blood, her expression one of intoxicated delight.  \n\n\"...\"  \n\nIgnoring the words that would never pass censorship, Ji Yan replied, \"Sis, everything needs a sense of novelty. Doing the same thing every day would just get dull.\"  \n\nHe had no intention of stealing Cheng Fang's lifeline, nor was there any need.  \n\n\"Speaking of which, there’s something I’d like to ask you.\"  \n\nSeizing the moment, Ji Yan steered the conversation toward his real purpose.  \n\n\"All that buildup, and this is why you came today.\"  \n\n\"Go on.\"  \n\nThe Charming Specter lounged in her chair, pulling out a thin cigarette, casually exposing Ji Yan’s little scheme.  \n\nJi Yan cleared his throat. \"I wanted to ask—does my so-called father have any enemies in this apartment?\"  \n\n\"Too many. You could say every resident in this building is his enemy.\"  \n\n\"That drunkard offended everyone just for a sip of liquor.\"  \n\n\"But if we’re talking about who wants him dead the most, it’s the guy in Room 702 on the 7th floor. After all, a wife’s murder isn’t something anyone would forgive.\"  \n\nHearing this, Ji Yan’s eyes gleamed.  \n\nAs expected, the original residents could provide more background on the Nightmare Devourer.  \n\nResting her chin on one hand, the Charming Specter noticed the shift in Ji Yan’s expression and smirked. \"You want to borrow another resident’s hand to kill that drunkard father of yours?\"  \n\n\"Don’t even dream of it. If he could be killed, he’d have died countless times already.\"  \n\n\"Why do you think he’s been hiding in Room 404 all this time? It’s the apartment’s rules that let him cling to life like a coward.\"  \n\nJi Yan shook his head. \"You’re overthinking it, sis. My father has been nothing but kind to me. How could I harbor such wicked thoughts?\"  \n\n\"I was just curious, worried for his safety.\"  \n\nWith that, he took out the Artist’s Wine Bottle and handed it to her.  \n\nAt the sight of it, the Charming Specter’s pretty face darkened. \"That greedy bastard.\"  \n\n\"After tasting sweetness yesterday, he’s now demanding an even bigger bottle.\"  \n\n\"Does he really think I’m easy to bully?\"  \n\nJi Yan said, \"You don’t have to fill it all the way.\"  \n\n\"And if you don’t, aren’t you afraid he’ll eat you?\" she countered.  \n\nJi Yan was the first player to give her a taste of novelty—she wasn’t about to let him disappear after just two days.  \n\n\"It’s fine. I don’t want to trouble you.\"  \n\nJi Yan wasn’t lying. He knew full well that whether the bottle was filled or not, he’d die either way—no difference.  \n\nBut to the Charming Specter’s ears, his words took on another meaning. \"Oh? So considerate of me? Though this sympathy act is a bit old.\"  \n\n\"Still, I do have a soft spot for this kind of routine.\"  \n\nJi Yan: \"...\"  \n\nIn the end, the Charming Specter still filled the bottle to the brim with Blood Pipa. Ji Yan said nothing, knowing full well her actions weren’t out of fondness.  \n\nThis Female Supernatural Entity just wanted him to live a little longer—so she could drain him dry at her leisure.  \n\nAs for Ji Yan’s so-called solution to break the deadlock? It was simple and brutal: eliminate the Nightmare Devourer!\n\nThe background setting of the Supernatural Game is that once a Supernatural Entity is killed, the mission resets, and the original mission is canceled.  \n\nHowever, few players care about this rule, as survival in the game is already difficult. Without sufficient equipment, who would be foolish enough to think about killing a Supernatural Entity?  \n\nBut Ji Yan had no choice—he was already past the point of no return.  \n\nAfter all, he knew the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity's weakness.  \n\nAccording to the background information he obtained from interacting with the Charming Specter, the knife capable of killing the Nightmare Devourer should be with the resident of Room 702.  \n\nThe resident of Room 702 wanted to kill the Nightmare Devourer, and so did Ji Yan. Their goals aligned, so obtaining this life-saving equipment shouldn’t be too difficult.  \n\nStepping out of the room, Ji Yan’s clothes were stained with the Charming Specter’s blood.  \n\nHe briefly greeted Cheng Fang before hurrying out of Room 101, carrying the fully filled Artist’s Wine Bottle of Blood Pipa.  \n\nCheng Fang took a bite of his last piece of pastry and muttered, “Is this guy here to complete the mission or to flirt with Supernatural Entities?”  \n\n“Hah, who knows? Maybe in a few more days, he’ll even ‘conquer’ that Female Supernatural Entity!”  \n\nCheng Fang laughed as he teased, but his laughter soon froze. His expression stiffened, and a sudden sense of crisis washed over him, leaving him drenched in cold sweat.  \n\n“Damn it!”  \n\n…  \n\nJi Yan had no idea what Cheng Fang was thinking at that moment. Right now, his mind was entirely focused on how to eliminate the Nightmare Devourer.  \n\nWithout stopping, he headed straight to the 7th floor of the apartment.  \n\nAccording to the apartment’s floor settings, the higher the floor, the fewer restrictions the Supernatural Entities faced.  \n\nThe residents of the 7th floor didn’t even need a mission—if a player accidentally entered their room, they could harm them directly!  \n\nThe corridor on the 7th floor had no lights, was littered with trash, and had peeling walls, resembling a lawless zone.  \n\nJi Yan walked along the hallway, checking the room numbers, when suddenly he felt something icy cold gripping his hand, as if he’d touched dry ice.  \n\nLooking down, he saw a girl in a tattered dress—who had seemingly appeared out of nowhere—holding his hand.  \n\nHer thin, frail body was covered in horrifying wounds, some fresh and bloody, clearly the result of brutal abuse.  \n\nThe girl raised her bruised face, pleading desperately with Ji Yan as she pointed toward Room 706 behind her, her voice trembling with urgency.  \n\n“Big brother, please… save us! Dad’s drunk, and he’s been beating Mom… she’s going to die…”  \n\n“Please… don’t leave, okay?”  \n\nJi Yan frowned at her. “I might not be able to stop your dad.”  \n\n“It’s okay! My dad is scared of the neighbors seeing. If you go in, he won’t dare hit Mom anymore… please!”  \n\nThe girl clung to Ji Yan like a lifeline, refusing to let go.  \n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Ji Yan nodded. “Fine. Lead the way, and I’ll do what I can.”  \n\nOverjoyed, the girl turned to guide him.  \n\nBut the moment she released his hand, Ji Yan spun around and bolted in the opposite direction without hesitation.  \n\nAs he ran, he called back, “What era is this? Who still falls for this kind of scam meant for toddlers? Are there really idiots who’d believe it?”  \n\nThe girl turned back, stunned to see Ji Yan sprinting away. In the next second, her pitiful expression twisted into something vicious and sinister…",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 10: Gouging Out the Specter's Eyeball, The Art of Conversation  \n\nThe Little Girl was stunned.  \n\nShe had never encountered such an unconventional Player before. In the past, they either fell for her trap foolishly or saw through it and turned hostile immediately. But this one?  \n\nShe stood frozen in place, her originally delicate face now crawling with black veins, her hair whipping wildly in the air.  \n\nYet, there was nothing she could do. The apartment’s rules imposed restrictions even on the 7th Floor—if the Player didn’t enter the room, the Supernatural Entity couldn’t bare its fangs.  \n\nJi Yan, who had sprinted to the corridor’s corner, suddenly halted.  \n\nBecause another information panel popped up before his eyes.  \n\n[Wraith Specter: Enjoys peeling off human skin and wearing it to alter its appearance, luring more prey. Loves extracting human bones to suck out the marrow, which refines its \"disguise\" technique.]\n\n[Weakness: Fears Extremely Yin Objects.]\n\n[Hidden Hint: Their eyeballs can be used for Supernatural Artifact Compatibility Enhancement and are a delicacy among many Supernatural Entities. Aren’t you going to claim this free gift?]\n\nThis time, the hidden hint wasn’t cryptic—it was straightforward.  \n\nAs for the Extremely Yin Object, even an idiot could guess what it referred to.  \n\nNothing was more Yin than the bottle of Blood Pipa in his hand. After all, it was brewed from the blood of that Female Supernatural Entity’s lower half…\n\nJi Yan, who had been about to leave, paused after reading the hidden message. Then, with a cold smirk, he turned back.  \n\nFortune favors the bold.  \n\nIn a place like the Eerie World, opportunities never fell into your lap unless you fought for them!\n\nThe Little Girl, who had been preparing to retreat to her room and wait for the next prey, was baffled when she saw Ji Yan returning.  \n\n\"Sorry, I just went to grab something. I was worried your dad might get violent with me too, so I brought a little hammer for self-defense.\"  \n\nJi Yan’s smile was pure and innocent as he lifted the seemingly ordinary Hammer in his hand.\n\nThe Little Girl hesitated.  \n\nShe couldn’t tell if Ji Yan was genuinely stupid or still playing her.  \n\nJi Yan urged her, \"Hurry up and take me there! Isn’t your mom about to be beaten to death?\"  \n\n\"O-Okay… Big Brother, you have to stay close this time! Don’t run away again!\"\n\nThe Little Girl grabbed Ji Yan’s shoulder with surprising strength, her tiny fingers digging in painfully as she dragged him toward Room 706.  \n\nSince he’d come back on his own, she wasn’t going to give him another chance to escape.  \n\n\"Once you step past that doorframe, no one can save you!\"\n\nAs the door drew nearer, the Little Girl’s lips twisted into a grotesque, crimson grin.  \n\nThud.\n\nShe crossed the threshold.  \n\nThen, another footstep followed.  \n\nJi Yan’s foot stepped over the doorframe, and in that instant, a mysterious protective force in the corridor vanished!  \n\nThe apartment’s rules, which had shielded Ji Yan as a Player, were now nullified. Once an outsider entered a resident’s room, the conflicting rules canceled each other out.\n\nThis meant the Supernatural Entity could now unleash its full savagery on the intruder in its domain!  \n\nThe Little Girl’s petite body swelled grotesquely, her frail skin splitting apart as thick, viscous blood sprayed out. Like a cicada shedding its shell, her limbs twisted and elongated—the Wraith Specter had revealed its true form, ravenous for its next meal.\n\n\"Big Brother, forget about my parents for now… My stomach has a much worse problem, and only you can help me…\"\n\nThe Wraith Specter began to reveal its true form, its throat bones cracking as its head twisted 360 degrees, its face now facing backward—as if it had already foreseen Ji Yan's terrified and shattered expression.  \n\nHowever,  \n\nIt didn’t see Ji Yan’s face.  \n\nWhat it saw first was a bloodstained hammer smashing straight toward it!  \n\n\"Hungry? Here, have a treasure!\"  \n\nJi Yan struck first.  \n\nHe interrupted the transformation mid-process!  \n\nWith a sickening crunch, the Wraith Specter’s jaw shattered, flesh and blood spraying from its mouth...\n\n\"ARGH—!\"  \n\nThe Wraith Specter let out a shrill howl, its head spinning from the impact, followed by a searing, unbearable pain in its shattered jaw.  \n\n\"You little brat, I’ll suck every last drop of marrow from your bones!!\"  \n\nRealizing it had been tricked again, the Wraith Specter erupted in fury, its body swelling to the height of an eight-foot monstrosity, its limbs elongating like grotesque spider legs.  \n\nBut before it could lash out, Ji Yan’s second hammer strike was already descending.  \n\nJi Yan believed trash talk was the most useless thing in the world—those wasted seconds could’ve been spent smashing a fist into the enemy’s face!  \n\nThe second hammer slammed into the top of its skull, sending up plumes of white smoke and filling the air with a nauseating stench.  \n\nThe Wraith Specter shrieked as the Blood Pipa’s residue on its skin burned like acid, corroding its flesh.  \n\n\"What the hell is this?!\"  \n\nClutching its rotting face, the Wraith Specter let out a piercing cry of terror.  \n\nJi Yan didn’t respond. Instead, he pressed his index and middle fingers together and drove them straight into the creature’s eye socket. With a sharp tug, he yanked out a string of thick, bloody fluid.  \n\nHolding the slippery eyeball, Ji Yan turned and walked away without another word.  \n\n\"You damn rat! You think you can just take my eye and leave?!\"  \n\nFinally understanding Ji Yan’s true motive for returning, the Wraith Specter—now covering its ruined face—tried to chase after him, its rage reaching its peak.  \n\nJi Yan stepped one foot over the threshold, then glanced back at the pursuing Wraith Specter, raising the entire bottle of Blood Pipa in his hand.  \n\nThe soul-piercing stench alone made Ji Yan’s head spin.  \n\n\"You trick me, I trick you—isn’t that just how this world works?\"  \n\n\"The eagle wants to eat the chick, but ends up losing an eye to the mother hen. It’s just bad luck. You’re not dumber than an eagle, are you?\"  \n\n\"If you keep chasing me, I won’t mind dumping this whole bottle on you. Taking one eye is just interest—you should be thanking me for my generosity!\"  \n\nThe Wraith Specter froze mid-step.  \n\nMissing an eye and half its face, it glared at Ji Yan but didn’t dare take another step forward.  \n\nJi Yan’s words weren’t particularly intimidating.  \n\nBut the full bottle of Blood Pipa in his hand was very real.  \n\nIt had no idea what that thing even was, only that it hurt like hell.  \n\nHelpless, the Wraith Specter could only watch as Ji Yan walked away with its eyeball...  \n\nSqueezing the slimy orb, Ji Yan noticed it could still move—as if it had a life of its own.  \n\nFor now, Ji Yan decided not to use the eyeball, storing it in his inventory. His priority was still reaching Room 702.  \n\nSince the numbering on the seventh floor was scrambled, it took him some time to find it.  \n\nJust as he raised his hand to knock, the door swung open on its own.  \n\nJi Yan blinked, then stepped inside.  \n\nBut the moment he saw the room’s interior, his expression stiffened slightly.\n\nThe chaotic living room appeared long abandoned, though that wasn’t the shocking part. Outside the balcony, corpses hung one after another—wrinkled, blackened, and shriveled—their toes dripping with corpse oil collected in basins.  \n\nOne black and one white cat crouched there, lapping at the corpse oil as if it were goat’s milk.  \n\nJi Yan stared at the two cats, an inexplicable chill running down his spine.  \n\nThey, in turn, fixed their golden slit-pupiled eyes on him.  \n\n\"You carry his scent.\"\n\nA voice rang out abruptly by his ear.  \n\nJi Yan whipped around and came face-to-face with a swollen, purplish-black head—split open by a hatchet embedded deep in its skull.  \n\nHis throat was seized in an instant.  \n\nThe figure leaned in, sniffing at Ji Yan before its expression twisted into something terrifying. \"You’re the dead drunkard from Room 404’s brat!\"\n\n\"Heh. I don’t know why you’re in my room, but any spawn of that bastard deserves death!\"\n\nJi Yan’s gaze flicked to the hatchet lodged in its forehead. He paused, then spoke, \"Wait—\"\n\nBut the entity gave him no chance. The moment it caught the scent of its sworn enemy, its mind flooded with nothing but murderous intent.  \n\nA dull pain erupted in Ji Yan’s chest. Looking down, he saw the creature’s hand had pierced through his flesh—clutching his heart.  \n\n\"That beast’s bastard offspring—even their hearts are black!\"\n\nJust as the creature yanked his heart outward, Ji Yan pulled out his hammer and struck the hatchet in its skull with a resounding—  \n\nCLANG!\n\nA sharp metallic screech tore through the air. The owner of Room 702 released Ji Yan, howling as it clutched its head. Thick, viscous blood oozed from the gaping wound.  \n\nJi Yan pressed a hand to his chest, lips curling into a grin. The sensation of having his heart squeezed was like a sudden heart attack—he’d nearly thought it was the end.  \n\n\"I know about your grudge—\"\n\n\"Die! Every last one of his whelps must die!\"\n\n\"I—\"\n\n\"DIE!!\"\n\n\"Fine. Then I’ll switch to a different way of talking.\"\n\nSeeing that the creature wasn’t listening to a single word, Ji Yan opted for the language of the hammer—delivering three consecutive blows to the embedded hatchet.  \n\nAgony tore through the owner of Room 702, its skull threatening to split apart. Cracks spiderwebbed across its head, its body convulsing violently from the pain.  \n\nSoon, the ferocity in its eyes faded—or rather, it could no longer even speak. Truly, the most effective way to reason with someone was through direct action. Words were just a waste of breath.  \n\n\"Do you like this way of talking?\"\n\n\"No? Then I’ll keep going.\"\n\nDripping hammer in hand, Ji Yan committed the most brutal acts while speaking the gentlest words...",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 11: Hatchet Acquired, Blessing Event  \n\nThe Owner of Room 702 glared with a mix of ferocity and frustration.  \n\nJi Yan flicked the Hatchet embedded in the man’s forehead with his finger and grinned. “Mind lending me this blade?”  \n\nThe moment the other heard Ji Yan was after the Hatchet, he gnashed his teeth and snapped, “Not a chance! This blade is only for—!”  \n\n“Only for killing my father, right? I know. That’s exactly who I’m after.”  \n\nThe Owner of Room 702 froze in confusion.  \n\n“You’re not his child?”  \n\nJi Yan didn’t bother hiding the truth and laid out the entire story.  \n\nAfter hearing it, the man remained skeptical. After all, the Hatchet lodged in his skull was a [Rare] Supernatural Artifact, and he’d been targeted by countless Players who tried every trick to interact with him and claim the weapon.  \n\nJi Yan had seen through it from the start.  \n\nThat Hatchet wasn’t just a [Rare] piece of equipment—its blade had three Sockets, meaning it could be enhanced with three additional attributes.  \n\nThe materials for socketing varied widely, and one of them was the Eyeball from the Wraith Specter currently in Ji Yan’s possession.  \n\nSocketing an Eyeball would increase accuracy by 30%.  \n\nThe better the material, the more it could upgrade the Supernatural Artifact!  \n\nIn essence, the Owner of Room 702 was a [Free NPC].  \n\nAny Player could interact with him.  \n\nThe Hatchet on his head was the reward equipment.  \n\nGenerally, there were two ways to obtain items from a Free NPC.  \n\nThe first was forced seizure—overpowering the NPC with brute strength, killing them, and taking the gear.  \n\nBut fruit plucked by force never tasted as sweet.  \n\nThe quality of the seized Hatchet would drop significantly.  \n\nTo obtain the equipment in perfect condition, only the second method worked: interaction. Trigger the background story, accept the Mission, complete it, and convince the NPC to willingly hand over the item.  \n\nThat was why Ji Yan had been so patient.  \n\nOtherwise, given his usual disdain for pointless chatter, he wouldn’t have settled for just three hammer strikes to “calm down” the Owner of Room 702. He’d have crushed the man’s skull outright, taken the Hatchet, and left.  \n\nBut doing so would degrade the weapon’s quality.  \n\nLow quality wasn’t the main issue.  \n\nThe real problem was that it might not be enough to kill the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity!  \n\n“Mind telling me what grudge you hold against my father?”  \n\nJi Yan continued probing for interaction. Without triggering the background story, the game Mission wouldn’t activate either.  \n\n“Hah! What a touching father-son bond. But why should I believe you?”  \n\nThe Owner of Room 702 wiped the blood oozing from his head, still refusing to divulge the backstory.  \n\nJi Yan suppressed his impatience. He knew time was short and didn’t want to waste any more of it here.  \n\n“I’ll give you my heart as collateral.”  \n\n“Lend me the Hatchet as a wager.”  \n\n“When I bring you that bastard’s head, you return my heart.”  \n\nJi Yan proposed a simple, straightforward, yet utterly insane deal.  \n\nThe Owner of Room 702 narrowed his eyes. “You’re betting your life with me?”  \n\n“At least with you, I still have a sliver of hope.”  \n\nJi Yan shrugged, his tone calm and natural.  \n\nHe knew the only way to establish trust was to let the other hold his lifeline.  \n\nThe man studied Ji Yan deeply, then suddenly thrust a hand into his chest—and yanked it back out.  \n\nA bloodless, violently pulsating heart was now clutched in his grip.  \n\nSeeing Ji Yan show no resistance, the Owner of Room 702 nodded.  \n\n“Good. Now that’s what I call a fair trade.”\n\n\"As long as you bring me that bastard's head, I'll return your heart, and this knife will be yours too.\"  \n\nIt placed the heart inside a black box.  \n\nTurning around, it sat on a chair, one hand caressing the rusted hatchet embedded in its skull.  \n\n\"That piece of trash used the very same hatchet on my head to chop off my wife's head—all for a sip of liquor.\"  \n\n\"A resident promised him a bottle of Collector's Grade grain liquor if he could procure a woman's body. That night, in the hallway, he set his sights on my wife.\"  \n\n\"He knows I'm after him, so he's been hiding in Room 404, using the apartment's rules to protect himself...\"  \n\nJi Yan picked at his ear, unmoved. He had already learned this backstory when the other party had choked him earlier.  \n\nBut unless the man said it himself, the mission wouldn’t trigger.  \n\nJi Yan: \"So, the only one who can get close to him without being restricted by the rules is me.\"  \n\n\"He’d never expect that the child he treated like a slave would actually think of killing his master!\"  \n\nThe moment Ji Yan finished speaking, the Information Panel popped up.  \n\nDing! Congratulations, Player, for successfully triggering an Open-ended Mission—A-level.\n\nYou have received a request from the Resident of Room 702: Kill the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity in Room 404, with no time limit!\n\nA-level!  \n\nKilling a Supernatural Entity was an A-level mission. He wondered what an S-level mission would be like.  \n\nJi Yan mused to himself.  \n\nOver there, reliving his most painful memories, the Resident of Room 702 grew increasingly agitated, eventually breaking down into loud sobs.  \n\nHe wanted to keep pouring out his grief to Ji Yan, but now that the mission had been triggered, Ji Yan had zero interest in the backstory.  \n\nIt was like playing a game—what player would sit through a long, tedious backstory introduction? Anyone who didn’t skip it deserved a thumbs-up.  \n\nThe Resident of Room 702 gripped the hilt and pulled out the rusted, rag-wrapped hatchet.  \n\nA torrent of blood gushed from the wound in his forehead, the horrific pain grinding his teeth to dust.  \n\nTo ensure he never forgot his wife’s murder, he had embedded the hatchet in his skull, using the constant pain to keep his hatred from fading with time.  \n\nHanding over the hatchet, the resident tried to continue rambling about his late wife’s backstory: \"My name is Liu Nianqing. The reason I’m called Nianqing is because—\"  \n\nBut Ji Yan snatched the hatchet and walked away without a word, leaving Liu Nianqing sitting in the chair, mouth slightly open before finally falling silent.  \n\n……  \n\nThough he now had the hatchet, since it was part of the mission, the Supernatural Artifact hadn’t been activated yet.  \n\nIn short, in Ji Yan’s hands, the hatchet could only deal fatal damage to the mission target—the Nightmare Devourer. For anything else, it was just a rusted piece of junk that couldn’t even cut flesh.  \n\nHe had the weapon, but killing the Nightmare Devourer wouldn’t be easy.  \n\nAfter all, Supernatural Entities didn’t just sit around waiting to be stabbed.  \n\n\"You must strike its chest. The head won’t work—only there can you kill it in one hit!\"  \n\n\"If you give it a chance to react, you’ll die horribly.\"  \n\n\"So you only get one shot!\"  \n\nThose were Liu Nianqing’s exact words, and they cranked Ji Yan’s pressure to the max.  \n\nGripping the hatchet tightly, Ji Yan knew he needed a solid plan.  \n\nTonight, Room 404 was bound to get lively…  \n\n……  \n\nSoon, Ji Yan returned to Room 404.\n\nUpon entering the house, Ji Yan immediately sensed something was amiss.  \n\nA pungent stench of corpses filled the air.  \n\nA sinister odor!  \n\nThen, he spotted Liu Yitong bustling around the dining table.  \n\nJust as Ji Yan was about to speak, Liu Yitong raised a finger to her lips, signaling silence, then pointed toward the kitchen.  \n\nFollowing her gesture, Ji Yan peered through the glass window and saw a blurry figure moving inside the kitchen.  \n\n\"The Mother Supernatural Entity left her room?\"  \n\nJi Yan froze for a moment.  \n\nThe resident Supernatural Entities of the cabin rarely stepped out of their rooms. If one appeared in the living area, it could only mean one of two things.  \n\nFirst—a [Blessing].\n\nSimply put, it was a purely beneficial interaction.  \n\nThe Supernatural Entity would initiate certain actions, and if the Player actively participated, they could randomly receive various rewards during the process.  \n\nThe type and value of the rewards depended entirely on the Player’s luck.  \n\nEven if the Player messed up, the Supernatural Entity wouldn’t turn hostile—the worst outcome was simply walking away empty-handed.  \n\nThis kind of event usually only triggered when a Player’s favorability with the Supernatural Entity reached a certain level, and it was exclusive to a single Player.  \n\nSecond—a [Punishment].\n\nThe meaning was self-explanatory. If a Player severely violated the cabin’s rules or caused the Supernatural Entity’s favorability to plummet to the point of hostility, the entity would emerge to deliver punishment to that specific Player.  \n\nJudging by Liu Yitong’s barely contained grin, the word \"joy\" practically written across her face, it was clearly a [Blessing].\n\nWho knew what this girl had done to keep raising the Mother Supernatural Entity’s favorability, even triggering a [Blessing]!\n\nThe interaction involved dining with the Mother Supernatural Entity.  \n\nAs for how many rewards Liu Yitong could obtain during the 20-minute dinner, that depended entirely on her skill and luck!  \n\nThis kind of beneficial event had nothing to do with other Players—they could only watch with envy.  \n\nSo Ji Yan had no interest in interfering. He deliberately stepped away from the dining table, took out the leftover coarse grains from this morning, and ate at the living room coffee table instead.  \n\nRight now, his mind was completely occupied with one thought—  \n\nKilling the Nightmare Devourer!  \n\nEven the biscuit in his mouth tasted bland…",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 12: Mission Failed, Supernatural Entity Blackened  \n\n\"How's your mission going?\"  \n\nSeeing Ji Yan lost in thought, Liu Yitong sat at the dining table and asked with mild concern.  \n\n\"Not going well.\"  \n\nJi Yan raised the half-filled bottle of Blood Pipa in his hand.  \n\nLiu Yitong frowned slightly at the sight but still offered comfort. \"It's fine. At least you have half of it.\"  \n\n\"If the mission is half-completed, the punishment won’t be too severe.\"  \n\n\"Besides, that Supernatural Entity—Father—is the hardest to deal with. If you get randomly assigned Mother or Grandmother tomorrow, just do your best to make up for it!\"  \n\n\"Those two are much easier to gain favor with. There’s no way you’ll get Father three days in a row, right?\"  \n\nLiu Yitong finished with a smile but suddenly covered her mouth.  \n\n...Actually, it might just happen.  \n\nAfter all, the guy in front of her had already hit rock bottom in terms of luck.  \n\nShe wanted to say something more to make up for it, but Ji Yan glanced behind her and mouthed: \"Mother’s here.\"  \n\nThe sliding window of the kitchen opened, and the appearance of the Mother Supernatural Entity was unexpectedly devoid of any horrifying traces.  \n\nWearing a pink apron, her hair tied in a ponytail, her face still carried a graceful charm with faint crow’s feet, giving off the image of a typical virtuous housewife.  \n\nBut Ji Yan knew—the more normal a Supernatural Entity looked, the more devastating the contrast would be once it blackened, delivering a brutal blow to the Player.  \n\nLiu Yitong quickly straightened up, focusing entirely on interacting with Mother during dinner.  \n\nSince the Mother Supernatural Entity currently had zero favorability with Ji Yan, he wisely avoided drawing her attention.  \n\nThis was someone else’s beneficial interaction event—there was no need for him to insert himself into the scene.  \n\nSoon, Dong Chu returned as well.  \n\nWhen he saw the Mother Supernatural Entity at the dining table, his eyes widened before he realized this was Liu Yitong’s [Blessing]. Jealousy flared as he muttered, \"A Blessing already? Damn it, why don’t I ever get one?\"\n\nAs the first veteran Player in Room 404, Liu Yitong was now thriving in this household, while he kept losing favorability with all three Supernatural family members. His resentment grew fiercer by the day...  \n\nHe knew that if this continued, he’d be \"logged out\" sooner or later.  \n\nSo he took some... proactive measures.  \n\nHis gaze landed on Ji Yan, who was sitting on the couch.  \n\nAnd then on the half-filled bottle of Blood Pipa. A cold smirk tugged at his lips. \"Looks like someone’s luck has run out today?\"  \n\nJi Yan glanced at Dong Chu and shrugged, smiling indifferently. \"There’s still half a bottle. It’s not that bad.\"  \n\n\"Half a bottle won’t save you from Father’s wrath.\"  \n\n\"That Supernatural Entity has zero favorability toward Players. If he catches even the slightest mistake, you’re doomed beyond redemption.\"  \n\n\"Did Liu Yitong feed you some nonsense again, and you actually believed her?\"  \n\n\"Unlike that hypocritical woman, I’m being honest with you.\"  \n\nDong Chu forced a grin at Ji Yan. \"Trust me, that half-bottle of Blood Pipa won’t keep you alive tonight!\"  \n\nEven a full bottle wouldn’t.  \n\nThis idiot had no idea—this mission had been a death trap designed by a certain Player and Supernatural Entity from the very beginning.  \n\nJi Yan listened, neither angered nor refuting.\n\nInstead, he nodded seriously, agreeing with Dong Chu's words: \"On second thought, you're right.\"  \n\n\"Since the mission has already failed, why bother submitting it? Might as well hide and delay as long as possible!\"  \n\nWith that, Ji Yan picked up the Blood Pipa and returned to his room, locking the door behind him.  \n\nDong Chu crossed his arms and sneered. \"Once the mission time expires, it’s an automatic failure.\"  \n\n\"A failed mission means the supernatural entity blackens, and the consequences will be even worse.\"  \n\nInside the room, Ji Yan listened to the taunts outside while staring at the Blood Pipa in the bottle.  \n\nDue to the alcohol bottle, the Blood Pipa had completely spoiled.  \n\nThis had already sealed the mission’s failure in advance.  \n\nThere was just one thing Ji Yan couldn’t understand.  \n\nWhy would the Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity choose to cooperate with Dong Chu to kill him?  \n\nLogically, as long as he was alive, the Nightmare Devourer could keep enjoying the Blood Pipa. There was no reason for it to cut off its own supply!  \n\nWhat temptation could be greater than its addiction to alcohol?  \n\nNot dwelling on it further, Ji Yan sat on the bed.  \n\nOutside the window, the thick fog coiled, and the Eerie World gradually darkened.  \n\nResting his chin in his hand, he simply waited.  \n\nHe was anticipating the arrival of night—and the Nightmare Devourer’s blackened form coming to settle the score with him...  \n\n......  \n\n\"You’re saying he didn’t submit the mission?\"  \n\nLiu Yitong, having just finished her [Blessing] welfare event, walked over. Upon hearing Ji Yan’s choice, her delicate face showed surprise.  \n\n\"Being afraid of death isn’t strange.\"  \n\n\"Afraid that once he goes in, he’ll never come out.\"  \n\n\"But he doesn’t realize that failing to submit the mission will make the blackened supernatural entity even more brutal. Thinking hiding in his room will save him? Once his door gets knocked on tonight, he’ll learn what true despair is.\"  \n\nDong Chu chewed on peanuts, his voice dripping with schadenfreude.  \n\n\"But at least he got half a bottle of Blood Pipa. The punishment will be halved too—he definitely won’t die, at least.\"  \n\nLiu Yitong frowned. She didn’t think Ji Yan would make such a foolish decision.  \n\nShe turned to Dong Chu. \"Did you say something to him?\"  \n\n\"I didn’t say anything.\"  \n\n\"As a veteran Player, giving him a few reminders is normal, right?\" Dong Chu shrugged, then changed the subject. \"How was your [Blessing]? Get anything good?\"  \n\n\"No.\"  \n\nLiu Yitong replied coldly and dismissively before returning to her room.  \n\nShe didn’t understand. Weren’t they all Players? Why was Dong Chu so hostile toward newcomers, even wishing for their downfall?  \n\nIn the Eerie World, shouldn’t people stick together? Was it just because Ji Yan had snapped at him yesterday?  \n\nLiu Yitong’s last shred of goodwill toward such a person vanished.  \n\n\"Stupid woman, now you’re giving me attitude too?\"  \n\n\"You think just because you’ve gotten cozy with the other two supernatural entities, you can step on me? My Talent is my real trump card.\"  \n\n\"One day, I’ll get rid of you too!\"  \n\nDong Chu glared at Liu Yitong’s closed door, his eyes flashing with cold malice.  \n\nThen he turned his gaze to Ji Yan’s room, equally puzzled.  \n\nThis kid didn’t seem that stupid—was he really planning to just sit in his room and wait to die?  \n\n......  \n\nNine o’clock at night. Darkness fell.  \n\nThe lights in the entire apartment went out, plunging every corner into pitch-black silence.\n\nIt seemed like a quiet night, but as the clock's hands passed midnight, a door deep in the corridor suddenly began to corrode rapidly, a thick stench of decay seeping through the cracks.  \n\nThen, the door to the father's room slowly opened.  \n\nThe Blackened Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity, shrouded in dark energy with crimson eyes, stood there.  \n\n\"Where is my alcohol? Why wasn't it delivered?\"  \n\nA voice brimming with boundless fury echoed through the apartment.  \n\nLiu Yitong and Dong Chu, lying in their respective beds, heard it all too clearly.  \n\nThey shut their eyes, pretending not to hear.  \n\nThey knew—Ji Yan was doomed!  \n\nAt the same time, an Information Panel popped up before Ji Yan's eyes.  \n\n\"Ding! The time limit for the Mission you accepted has expired. Due to failure to submit, the system has judged it as a failure.\"  \n\n\"Warning! By failing to complete the Mission, you have violated the rules, causing the father to blacken. Punishment is imminent!\"  \n\nFacing the red warning panel, Ji Yan remained calm, silently closing the Information Panel.  \n\nThen, he retrieved an item from his Toolbar...",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 13: The Supernatural Artifact Mask, Completing Patricide  \n\nBoom!\n\nA door was violently smashed open, the handle shattered, and its parts scattered across the floor.  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer Supernatural Entity, wreathed in towering fury, had grown unnaturally large, its grotesque muscles writhing and swelling.  \n\n\"Tell me, where is my wine?\"  \n\nIts crimson gaze swept across the room before locking onto the wooden bed.  \n\nBut when the blanket was flung aside, the bed was empty.  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer's lips twisted into a sinister sneer. \"Think you can run?\"  \n\nIn truth, Ji Yan's actions played right into its hands. From the very beginning, it had never intended to let him complete the mission smoothly.  \n\nThough it could occasionally obtain Blood Pipa from the Charming Specter in Room 101 through Ji Yan to satisfy its addiction, it still couldn’t indulge freely every day. However, if it could seize Ji Yan for failing the mission and keep him firmly under control, it could negotiate with the Charming Specter in Room 101. Over time, it might even secure an endless supply of Blood Pipa through exploitation…  \n\nThis plan wasn’t foolproof.  \n\nEven the Nightmare Devourer feared the Charming Specter when she lost her temper.  \n\nBut the Nightmare Devourer, now utterly obsessed with Blood Pipa and devoid of resistance, couldn’t be bothered to overthink it.  \n\nForcing Ji Yan to fail wasn’t easy, either.  \n\nSo, it struck a deal with Dong Chu.  \n\nPlayers could interfere with missions, but only through Dong Chu setting traps for Ji Yan.  \n\nWhat Dong Chu wanted was simple:  \n\nFood, and all of Ji Yan’s equipment.  \n\nBlinded in one eye and starving, he had to find his own way to survive.  \n\nDong Chu’s Talent Trait, Survival in Desperation, only activated when his favorability hit rock bottom and his living conditions became dire.\n\nThe trait granted him certain privileges to seize survival on his own.  \n\nThe triggered privilege was the ability to leave his room at night, immune to supernatural harassment—but only once. This allowed Dong Chu to enter the Nightmare Devourer’s room and secretly finalize their deal.  \n\nThe trait was practically useless.  \n\nIt merely offered a sliver of hope when death was near, leaving it up to the user to grasp it.  \n\nSo Dong Chu had never relied on it or even revealed its existence.  \n\n\"Even with such a trash-tier trait, I’ve maximized its benefits. I’m a genius!\"  \n\nWith his hands behind his head, Dong Chu anticipated a peaceful night’s sleep.  \n\nAll he had to do was wake up the next morning and reap his rewards.  \n\nInside Room 404, the Nightmare Devourer couldn’t catch even a whiff of Ji Yan’s scent.  \n\nFrowning, it turned toward the doorway. \"Did he hide in that woman’s room?\"  \n\nIts first thought was the Charming Specter in Room 101. After all, that woman always opposed it—it wasn’t impossible she’d poached Ji Yan.  \n\nThe apartment at night spawned many extremely vicious supernatural entities. These weren’t current residents but former ones who had been driven out.  \n\nThese entities were riddled with danger zones and prone to corruption.  \n\nIf Ji Yan got wiped out by another supernatural entity, all the Nightmare Devourer’s efforts would be for nothing.  \n\nIn the living room, shadowy figures lurked.  \n\nThey were Room 404’s original occupants, later conquered by players and repurposed as night-mode NPCs.  \n\nThough no longer the room’s masters, they made themselves at home—watching TV, sipping tea, or sneaking food in the kitchen.\n\n\"A bunch of worthless rejects, still treating this place like their own home!\"  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer wanted to go out and catch Ji Yan, but suddenly remembered its deadly rival on the 7th floor. If that thing caught its scent, it would surely go berserk and chase it down...  \n\nIts eyes darkened with malice.  \n\nThe alcohol craving hit hard, making its body feel like it was being gnawed by ten thousand ants. It twitched in discomfort.  \n\nIt turned to head back inside, intending to take a few swigs to calm down.  \n\nBut as it turned, it saw a disheveled-looking supernatural entity sitting in the hallway, clutching a bottle of deep red liquor, utterly wasted.  \n\nThe moment the cork was twisted open, the Nightmare Devourer already knew what kind of liquor it was.  \n\nBlood Pipa!  \n\n\"Where did you get that?\" the Nightmare Devourer demanded. It recognized the bottle—it was the same Supernatural Artifact that Dong Chu had.  \n\n\"Got it off a little rat,\" the Drunken Supernatural Entity slurred.  \n\n\"And where's that little rat now?\"  \n\n\"Ran off the moment I snatched the bottle,\" the Drunken Supernatural Entity replied, swaying as it held up the half-empty bottle of Blood Pipa.  \n\n\"Hey, what do you think this stuff’s brewed from? Hits like a damn hammer, heh heh...\"  \n\n\"...\"  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer’s face twisted into a snarl as it glared at the Drunken Supernatural Entity. \"You didn’t know that was my prey?\"  \n\nThe Drunken Supernatural Entity didn’t respond, just mumbled incoherently in its drunken stupor.  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer snatched the bottle and gulped down the liquor in huge swigs. Its addiction was too overwhelming to care about anything else...  \n\nIt drained the bottle completely, letting out a satisfied howl of delight.  \n\nBut its head also grew heavy from the numbing effects, dizziness crashing over it.  \n\nTossing the empty bottle aside, the Drunken Supernatural Entity picked it up and shook it twice, resentment boiling. \"Damn you! You drank it all! You owe me!\"  \n\n\"You scared off my prey, and I haven’t even settled that with you yet!\"  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer snorted coldly, its mood foul, stumbling back toward its room.  \n\nBut after just two steps, its dizziness worsened.  \n\nIts room blurred into multiple overlapping images.  \n\nLowering its head, in a daze, it saw a rusted, mottled blade protruding from its chest...  \n\nWhy did that blade look so familiar?  \n\nThe next second, its pupils shrank, veins bulging in fury.  \n\nThe haze of drunkenness and numbness vanished in an instant!  \n\nIt whipped its head around, locking onto the Drunken Supernatural Entity behind it, its voice a distorted snarl through broken teeth: \"Where... did you get this blade?!\"  \n\nThe Drunken Supernatural Entity’s horrifying face no longer held any trace of drunkenness, only a mocking smirk. \"An old friend of yours gave it to me.\"  \n\n\"He told me to pass on a message.\"  \n\n\"His wife misses you dearly!\"  \n\nAs the Rusted Hatchet drove deeper, blood gushed from the grotesque tumor-like flesh, cracks spreading outward.  \n\nAt those words, the Nightmare Devourer’s brutish face trembled violently, fear flooding its expression.  \n\nIt clawed at the hatchet embedded in its chest.  \n\nBut the blade seemed welded in place, sinking deeper into its flesh!  \n\n\"No... no! I worked so hard to become a resident of Room 404... I don’t want to be erased! I still have so much fine liquor hidden away...\"  \n\n\"You! Who the hell are you?! Why are you helping that bastard from Room 702?!\"  \n\nThe Drunken Supernatural Entity didn’t dare relax for even a second, pushing the blade in until it was fully buried in the Nightmare Devourer’s body—confirming its heart had been pierced!\n\nHe raised his head, a smirk tugging at the corners of his lips under the Nightmare Devourer's gaze. \"Fatherly kindness and filial piety—guess who I am?\"  \n\nAs the words fell, the Rusted Hatchet was yanked out violently.  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer staggered in the hallway, the gash in its chest widening relentlessly.  \n\nFrom the living room and kitchen, the Supernatural Entities that spawned at midnight all gathered, crowding the hallway entrance, watching the scene unfold with a clamorous excitement.  \n\nFinally, the Nightmare Devourer collapsed to the ground, its bloated flesh visibly withering and drying up. Its bulging eyes stared fixedly at Ji Yan.  \n\nThe Drunken Supernatural Entity stood expressionless, gripping the Rusted Hatchet tightly, though its hand trembled slightly.  \n\nOnly when the corpse on the ground had completely turned into a pile of desiccated flesh and blood did it react.  \n\n\"You killed him… hehe… killed him…\"  \n\n\"You… why do you smell so delicious?\"  \n\nThe other Supernatural Entities gradually closed in, surrounding the corpse on the ground. But a few of them seemed to catch a whiff of something, their noses twitching as they sniffed around the Drunken Supernatural Entity.  \n\nA sharp pain lanced through its cheek.  \n\nTouching its face, the Drunken Supernatural Entity realized its entire skin was slowly splitting apart!  \n\nJi Yan cursed inwardly.  \n\n\"The Murderous Mask’s effect is about to wear off!\"  \n\nHe weaved through the throng of Supernatural Entities, hastily retreating to his room.  \n\nSlamming the door shut, he locked it securely.  \n\nOutside, the sounds of tearing and chewing filled the air—the midnight Supernatural Entities were feasting on the Nightmare Devourer.  \n\n\"With this, even a dungeon boss would be doomed, right?\"  \n\nMuttering to himself, Ji Yan sat before the mirror.  \n\nAs the Supernatural Artifact’s effect neared its end, his entire face now looked horrifying.  \n\nHis features were splitting apart, exposing the pale bones beneath. At a glance, it seemed as though his skull was about to shatter into pieces!  \n\nThe excruciating pain in his cheeks came from the bone spikes at the mask’s edges retracting from his flesh, blood staining his neck…  \n\nThe murderous aura of the Supernatural Entity clinging to Ji Yan was dissipating, revealing his true scent as a human Player.  \n\nThat was why those Supernatural Entities had been drawn to him earlier. Had he been even a few minutes slower returning to his room, he would’ve joined the Nightmare Devourer as a shared meal for the creatures outside…  \n\nCarefully, he reached up and removed the mask.  \n\nThick, black blood dripped onto the table in sticky splotches. With a clatter, the human-skin mask was tossed into the corner.  \n\nJi Yan touched his own flawless, handsome face and finally let out a sigh of relief.  \n\n\"I actually managed to kill the Nightmare Devourer.\"  \n\nThis desperate, last-ditch method of breaking the deadlock felt surreal even to him, the perpetrator.  \n\nIt wasn’t until the game panel popped up, further confirming that he had indeed overturned this hopeless situation, that he truly believed it.  \n\n\"Ding! Player has successfully killed the 404 Cabin Family Supernatural Entities, unlocking a new achievement!\"",

What’s the point of keeping a failed father who was always drunk and violent? His disappearance will make this family happier and more harmonious!\"  \n\nJi Yan’s eyes widened slightly.  \n\nKilling a family Supernatural Entity actually gave so many rewards?  \n\nBut upon closer thought, the risks involved seemed to justify them.  \n\nHe retrieved the newly acquired artifact from the Toolbar.  \n\nIt was a wall clock with its hour, minute, and second hands completely disordered, looking utterly ordinary, as if it had been broken for years.  \n\nJi Yan tapped to check the artifact’s information.  \n\n\"Artifact Background—Every night before lights out, Mother would tell the Little Girl a story to help her sleep. Later, to see Mother sooner, the girl set the alarm clock on her bedside earlier. But after that night, Mother never appeared again…\"  \n\nThe backstory was vague and slightly eerie.  \n\nJi Yan wasn’t particularly interested, but when he checked the artifact’s effects, his eyes lit up…  \n\nHe glanced at the time in the room—3:30 AM.  \n\nThe troublesome source, the Nightmare Devourer, had been dealt with.  \n\n\"Next, it’s Dong Chu’s turn.\"  \n\nHe didn’t like holding grudges overnight. If there was a score to settle, he’d do it immediately.  \n\nAs players surviving under the same roof, Ji Yan hadn’t wanted to escalate things with Dong Chu. A few exchanged barbs shouldn’t have led to this.  \n\nBut he’d underestimated the depths of human malice.  \n\nNow, it was time to return the favor…  \n\nThat night, Dong Chu slept soundly.  \n\nIn his dreams, he faintly heard Ji Yan’s screams, which only made his sleep more peaceful.  \n\nThe next morning, the misty dawn arrived.  \n\nThe alarm rang, and Dong Chu woke up groggily, silencing the shrill noise.  \n\nNot daring to delay, he quickly dressed and left his room.  \n\nIn the living room, Liu Yitong was nowhere to be seen today. Instead, at the dining table, a large, round-faced figure was hunched over, devouring food.  \n\n\"Fa… Father?!\"  \n\nDong Chu froze.  \n\nThe Supernatural Entity Father had actually left his room—this was even rarer than the other two entities appearing!  \n\nA bad feeling crept into his heart.  \n\nHad something gone wrong last night?  \n\nUneasy, the Nightmare Devourer squeezed out a single word at him.  \n\n\"Sit.\"  \n\nDong Chu sat down, feeling as if he were on pins and needles.  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer’s grotesque, pustule-covered face turned toward him, then twisted into a smile uglier than a grimace.  \n\n\"As a father, it seems I haven’t had breakfast with my child in a long time. Today, I made sure to wake up early.\"\n\n\"Among the three children, I hold you in the highest regard.\"  \n\n\"Deep in thought, decisive—only someone like you is worthy of being my child!\"  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer curled its lips, revealing a row of yellowed teeth as it lavished praise without restraint.  \n\nTo Dong Chu, this was as unbelievable as seeing the sun rise from the west.  \n\nDid I hear that right?\n\nWait… Could it be that I’ve gained favor with this Supernatural Entity and triggered a [Blessing]?\n\nIt suddenly dawned on him—this breakfast invitation was a reward event.  \n\nHis heart swirled with disbelief and excitement.  \n\nSo even this Supernatural Entity can be won over!\n\nFor the sake of gaining favor, he suppressed his disgust and forced himself to eat the food on the table.  \n\n\"Father… about my younger brother last night… how is he?\"  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer shoved a piece of sauce-drenched meat into its mouth.  \n\n\"What, you still haven’t realized?\"  \n\n\"Everything on this table—it’s your dear little brother.\"  \n\nDong Chu froze, staring at the steaming plates of meat on the table. His stomach churned, and he nearly vomited on the spot.  \n\nThe Nightmare Devourer’s thick brows furrowed. \"What’s wrong? Are you going to throw up the breakfast your father worked so hard to prepare for you?\"  \n\nDong Chu’s face turned ashen, his hands clapped over his mouth.  \n\nAfter an internal struggle, he forced himself to swallow it down.  \n\nIt’s fine, it’s fine. After all, this is just the Supernatural Game, not the real world.\n\nEating it means nothing. It’s not like I’m committing some moral atrocity or losing my humanity.\n\nHe comforted himself like this.  \n\nBut as he ate, something felt off.  \n\nHe opened his [Information Panel]—no updates.  \n\nThat’s not right. If Ji Yan really died, why hasn’t my [Talent] triggered to loot his equipment?\n\nStaring at the motionless [Toolbar], Dong Chu frowned in confusion. His head felt heavy, and he shook it vigorously.  \n\nWhen he looked up again, the bright daylight outside the balcony was slowly darkening.  \n\nIn the blink of an eye—it turned to night!  \n\nHe stiffened, then whipped his head toward the wall.  \n\nThe old pendulum clock still displayed the time: 3:30 AM.  \n\n\"What’s going on?\"  \n\n\"...Wasn’t it already morning? I clearly heard the alarm!\"  \n\nHis mind blanked, then realization struck—his scalp prickled with terror.  \n\nHe bolted into the hallway, sprinting toward his room!  \n\nA Ghostly Child, clad in a diaper with ashen skin, crouched outside his door, clutching a headless rag doll.  \n\nIts pitch-black eyes, devoid of whites, fixed on Dong Chu.  \n\n\"Big brother, my doll’s head is missing again. Can you help me find it?\"  \n\nDong Chu’s heart skipped a beat.  \n\nHe didn’t dare respond—he knew full well that answering meant accepting a [Mission].  \n\nAnd in the dead of night, the fatality rate of a Supernatural Entity’s task was nearly 99%!  \n\nHe desperately pounded on the door to Liu Yitong’s room, screaming, \"Liu Yitong!! Open up! Save me! Stop pretending to sleep!\"  \n\nLiu Yitong heard him.  \n\nPulling the blanket over his head, he covered his ears and muttered, \"So annoying. These Supernatural things and their same old tricks every night!\"  \n\nDong Chu was sound asleep in his own room. How could he possibly be outside?\n\n\"Big brother, big brother, why won't you answer me?\"  \n\n\"Please, help me find my doll's head. It was a birthday gift from Father. If he finds out it's missing, he'll beat me.\"  \n\nThe Ghostly Child stepped closer, its voice pleading, but the signs of blackening grew more pronounced.  \n\nDong Chu retreated step by step until his back pressed against Ji Yan's door. He paused, then tentatively knocked twice.  \n\n\"Ji Yan?\"  \n\n\"What?\"  \n\nDong Chu's pupils shrank—the voice from inside the room responded.  \n\nHe wasn’t dead!  \n\nWhy wasn’t he dead?  \n\n\"You... you...\" He stammered incoherently.  \n\n\"Why am I not dead?\"  \n\n\"Why don’t you take a guess?\" Ji Yan's calm voice drifted from within.  \n\nDong Chu reacted quickly. Right now, Ji Yan’s survival wasn’t the issue. Desperation colored his words: \"Ji Yan, don’t take what I said earlier to heart. I was just looking out for you, trying to make sure you stayed sharp.\"  \n\n\"I was teaching you how to survive in this dungeon. I never meant you any harm. Just open the door, okay?\"  \n\nThe will to live made him grovel. All he could think about was getting inside that room—survival first.  \n\nFrom inside came Ji Yan’s icy laugh. \"True, I should thank you.\"  \n\n\"If not for your elaborate scheme, I wouldn’t have had the chance to kill that Supernatural Entity Father, let alone reap so many rewards.\"  \n\n\"So, as repayment...\"  \n\n\"That Supernatural Artifact Alcohol Bottle you gave me? I’ve returned it to you, completely intact.\"  \n\nDong Chu’s lips parted. His face paled.  \n\n\"You knew?? You knew all along?!\"  \n\n\"Then it was you who lured me out of my room in the middle of the night?\"  \n\nDong Chu’s eyes burned red.  \n\n\"You offered me a toast. I returned the favor.\"  \n\n\"Reciprocity—what’s wrong with that?\"  \n\n\"In the next dungeon, learn to be smarter. Don’t provoke those you shouldn’t.\"  \n\n\"Goodnight.\"  \n\nJi Yan yawned and returned to bed.  \n\nOutside, Dong Chu’s screams and curses turned hysterical—until the Ghostly Child behind him, ignored and unanswered, fully blackened.  \n\nSmall hands cupped his neck. \"Big brother, why won’t you answer me?\"  \n\n\"Your head... looks perfect. Can I put it on my doll’s neck?\"  \n\nBefore Dong Chu could respond, those tiny hands lifted gently—and his head came clean off.  \n\nBlood sprayed. The headless corpse crumpled to the floor.  \n\nThe Ghostly Child skipped away, balancing the head and the doll, until it vanished into the darkness.  \n\n\"What a hectic night.\"  \n\n\"At least it was fruitful—and I got rid of a pesky fly.\"  \n\nHands behind his head, Ji Yan murmured as he closed his eyes and drifted into peaceful sleep.",

    "content": "第15章首见奶奶，香囊任务\n\n清晨。\n摆钟敲响，白雾萦绕。\n嘎吱一声，刘艺桐的房间门缓缓打开。\n看到通道内残留的血污，她嘴里嘟嚷一句：“昨晚还真是热闹啊，不知道是哪个诡，打了鸡血一样，一直敲我的门，吵死了！”\n她生气。\n不是因为起床气。\n而是玩家在夜晚休息不足，第二天的状态数值也会有所下降。\n甚至精神委靡，意识混乱，很容易影响任务。\n她走向客厅，准备简单的洗漱。\n但很快，她发现了不对。\n通道变短了。\n副本生存22天，她每天走了不知多少遍，对这个家每一寸都已经有肌肉记忆。\n不会错，寝室通道怎么变短了？\n她扭过脑袋，左右看了眼，突然俏容一变。\n原本还有的两间房门消失了！\n六房一厅的套房，变成了四房一厅。\n她第一个想到了纪言，可仔细查看消失的两间房间后，发现是董褚和父亲诡的！\n她歪着脑袋，懵了。\n巧在这时，纪言也开门走了出来。\n“早，又是元气满满的一天。”\n纪言简单打了个招呼。\n“纪言，董褚他……”\n纪言回头带着一丝笑意：“你也听见了？昨晚上那家伙一直敲我的房门，我还以为是诡异模仿的声音呢。”\n“现在看来，真是那家伙，你说他一个老玩家，怎么还犯这种低级错误呢？”\n刘艺桐沉默了。\n她也清楚董褚不会犯这种错误，除非……\n眼眸闪烁片刻，刘艺桐没有继续多问。\n果然，无论在什么环境，人心之间搏杀都这么可怕。\n她并没有多同情董褚，像这种一己之私，所有都该围着他转的人，死了反而少了个定时炸弹，长松一口气。\n“不过，父亲这只诡是怎么死的？你……怎么办到的？”\n刘艺桐还是忍不住问了这个。\n父亲诡雷区最多，任务也最凶险，一夜之间，这个对玩家最大的威胁居然就这么除掉了！\n餐桌上，纪言吞咽着小麦面包：“是不是我杀的，其实不重要。”\n“我只知道，404小屋没有了父亲这只毒瘤诡，会变地温馨安全许多。”\n“你说对吗？”\n这话已经变相证明了是他做的，同样也有言外之意———当一个人做了一件对集体有利益的好事，无需多问，静静地享受好吃就行。\n刘艺桐恍然。\n点点头：“说的太对了。”\n果然，当初没有跟董褚那样，排斥这个新人是对的。\n姓董的就是个蠢蛋！\n简单地吃过早餐，通道内很快传来呼唤。\n新的一天任务开始领取。\n刘艺桐还是分配到了母亲的任务。\n她现在可以说完全没有压力。\n母亲对她好感度已经累积到70%！\n超过65%，就会触发【恩赐】福利。\n即便她一两次任务失败，也只是降低一下好感度，不会有任何惩罚。\n而当好感度叠满100%，就会达成【完美攻略】成就，将不必再进行每日提心吊胆的任务。\n攻略的诡异，不会再有黑化的风险，甚至当你招惹了其它诡异住客，它们还会出手替你挡灾。\n到那种程度，小屋才算真正意义上避风港。\n这也是刘艺桐和董褚每天费尽心思完成任务，尽量让诡异家人满意为止的原因。\n不攻略，难以在副本立足！\n这就像极了攻略养成游戏。\n“别担心，奶奶比父亲和善许多，虽然她对男玩家没什么好感，但也不会刻意针对。”\n刘艺桐对纪言提醒道。\n她很害怕纪言一个不爽冲动，把诡异奶奶也给做掉了！\n这样她在诡异奶奶身上花费的心思可就全都白费了。\n“放心。”\n“我也想攻略，如果把404小屋的诡异家人都干掉了，那咱们404小屋跟家破人亡没区别。”\n纪言知道她想什么，这是把他当成不服就杀的莽夫了？\n没有多言，两人相聚进入了各自的诡异家人房间。\n奶奶的房间内保留了老一辈的风格，很多物品物件都带着岁月的痕迹，空气弥漫着一股针织衣物的棉酸味。\n床上，奶奶坐在那里，手中编织着一件毛衣，而一旁已经堆积成了小山。\n对她来说，仿佛有着永远编织不完的毛衣。\n“孩子，虽然第一次见，但你比那乍乍呼呼的小子看着顺眼多了。”\n奶奶垂落眼皮，对纪言评价了一句。\n纪言知道说的是董褚，这哥们也是惨，都下线了还要被Q一波。\n人缘诡缘都处不好，能生存二十多天也是奇迹。\n“这话我十分赞同奶奶。”\n目前看来诡异奶奶的确好互动许多，比那个超雄似的诡异父亲强多了……\n“这个，帮奶奶穿一下，奶奶眼力不好。”\n诡异奶奶递过来线头跟针。\n纪言接过，他眼力还是可以的，一次就成功穿过了针线圈。\n“我不过问你怎么弄死你父亲的，如果不是我出不了房间，那个白眼狼早被我碾碎了脑袋。”\n“当初我的好几个乖孙女，都被那畜生拿去给101那个狐狸精当了酒钱！”\n“你相当于帮奶奶做了一件大善事。”\n奶奶沙哑说着。\n这里可以听出，404小屋内诡异之间，都有着不小的恩怨，它们和玩家一样，只是扮演着各自的角色。\n也难怪，杀死魇食诡后，他会在奶奶和母亲各自身上白嫖到了20%的好感度。\n“想不想奶奶更加疼爱你？奶奶有两个心结，解开一个，以后在公寓里，除了那房东，甭管是谁只要进了404，都碰不了你一根头发。”\n心结！\n听到关键字眼，纪言眼眉挑动。\n小部分的诡异都会有心结，一旦帮对方解开，保底获取50%好感度！\n“不知道奶奶有什么心结？”纪言试着问。\n诡异奶奶问：“你母亲见过了吗？”\n“见过一面。”\n“弄死她，只要她在404小屋消失，奶奶以后只独宠你一个。”\n奶奶放下毛衣，眼睛眯缝，笑容和蔼。\n纪言：“……”\n就知道没这么容易。\n“好了，不为难你了。”\n奶奶随手丢过来一个香囊包，继续埋头针织毛衣：“拿这个香囊，送到605房间去。”\n“收不收，没所谓，送到就行。”\n“回来后，奶奶我亲自给你编织一件毛衣。”\n“给男娃编织毛衣，你还是第一个呢。”\n奶奶抬起那张慈眉善目的脸：“这好处，一般的奶奶可不给别人，还是看在你昨晚上干了件大好事的份上。”\n纪言微微一愣。\n看着递过来的香囊。\n上面绣着岁岁平安。\n这么简单？\n纪言有些压不住嘴角，这不是纯福利任务？\n奶奶编织的毛衣，刘艺桐手里也有一件。\n纪言获取过信息，保底稀有品质。\n穿在身上，免疫30%诡异伤害，实打实的防弹衣。\n“放心奶奶，我一定送到。”\n纪言接过，这单纯跑个腿的活，傻子才不收。\n奶奶呵呵笑了笑，继续埋头编织。\n纪言从房间退出来后。\n手中的香囊才触发天赋，弹出隐藏信息框：“香囊是“筑楼”的根基材料之一，为了缝补好它，奶奶耗费了半个月心血，甚至折损了三幅针线，猜猜看，这栋破残不堪的公寓为什么能在诡异世界屹立而不倒？”\n纪言看了眼面板内容，不禁疑惑。\n筑楼。\n意思是建筑公寓楼的材料是这个香囊？\n这隐藏信息看的云里雾里。\n纪言摇摇头，没多去在意。\n说白了，送到就行，香囊什么用处，来头是什么，都跟他无关。\n刚关闭信息面板，对立房间的刘艺桐也出来了，手里拎着一个空的酱油瓶。\n“不是，又是打酱油的任务？这母亲诡吃酱油的？”\n一看到瓶子，纪言都忍不住吐槽了。\n这就是好感度高的好处啊！\n同样的任务奖励，别人再鬼门关走了几圈，才命悬一线的完成，刘艺桐下楼打个酱油，就完成了。\n这搁谁见了不眼红？\n刘艺桐摸摸脑袋，也有些不好意思了。\n母亲这偏爱确实太明显了。\n她反问支开话题：“你今天什么任务？”\n“任务面板还没弹出来，奶奶就给了我一个香囊。”\n纪言拎着岁岁平安的香囊。\n然而一看到香囊，刘艺桐的俏脸却是变地有些白……",
    "translatedContent": "Chapter 15: First Meeting with Grandmother, the Sachet Mission  \n\nEarly morning.  \n\nThe pendulum clock chimed, and white mist lingered in the air.  \n\nWith a creak, Liu Yitong’s door slowly opened.  \n\nSeeing the bloodstains still smeared across the hallway, she muttered under her breath, “Last night was really lively, huh? I wonder which Supernatural Entity was so pumped up, banging on my door nonstop—so annoying!”  \n\nShe was angry.  \n\nNot because she was groggy from waking up.  \n\nBut because if Players didn’t get enough rest at night, their stats the next day would suffer.  \n\nThey might even become mentally exhausted and disoriented, which could easily affect their Missions.  \n\nShe headed to the living room, planning to freshen up quickly.  \n\nBut soon, she noticed something was off.  \n\nThe hallway had gotten shorter.  \n\nAfter surviving in this dungeon for 22 days, she had walked these paths countless times. Every inch of this apartment was ingrained in her muscle memory.  \n\nShe couldn’t be wrong—why was the hallway shorter now?  \n\nShe turned her head, glancing left and right, and suddenly her expression changed.  \n\nTwo of the doors that had been there before were gone!  \n\nThe six-bedroom, one-living-room suite had become a four-bedroom, one-living-room setup.  \n\nHer first thought was Ji Yan, but after a closer look at the missing rooms, she realized they belonged to Dong Chu and the Father Supernatural Entity!  \n\nTilting her head in confusion, she froze.  \n\nCoincidentally, Ji Yan also opened his door and stepped out at that moment.  \n\n“Morning. Another energetic day ahead,” he greeted casually.  \n\n“Ji Yan, Dong Chu, he…”  \n\nJi Yan turned back with a faint smile. “You heard it too? That guy kept knocking on my door last night. I thought it was just a Supernatural Entity mimicking sounds.”  \n\n“But now it seems it really was him. How could a veteran Player make such a rookie mistake?”  \n\nLiu Yitong fell silent.  \n\nShe also knew Dong Chu wouldn’t make such a mistake—unless…  \n\nHer eyes flickered briefly, but she didn’t press further.  \n\nIndeed, no matter the environment, the battles between human hearts were always this terrifying.  \n\nShe didn’t feel much sympathy for Dong Chu. Someone so selfish, who expected everything to revolve around him—his death was more like defusing a ticking time bomb. She let out a long sigh of relief.  \n\n“But… how did the Father Supernatural Entity die? How did you… manage that?”  \n\nLiu Yitong couldn’t help but ask.  \n\nThe Father Supernatural Entity had the most Danger Zones and the deadliest Missions. Overnight, the biggest threat to Players had been eliminated just like that!  \n\nAt the dining table, Ji Yan chewed on a piece of wheat bread. “Whether I killed him or not isn’t really important.”  \n\n“All I know is that without that tumor of a Father Supernatural Entity in Room 404, this place will become much cozier and safer.”  \n\n“Don’t you agree?”  \n\nHis words indirectly confirmed his involvement while also carrying an unspoken message—when someone does something beneficial for the group, there’s no need to ask questions. Just quietly enjoy the benefits.  \n\nLiu Yitong suddenly understood.  \n\nShe nodded. “You’re absolutely right.”  \n\nAs expected, her decision not to reject this newcomer like Dong Chu had was the right one.  \n\nThat Dong guy was a complete idiot!  \n\nAfter a simple breakfast, a call soon echoed through the hallway.  \n\nThe new day’s Missions were about to be assigned.  \n\nLiu Yitong was once again given a Mission by the Mother Supernatural Entity.  \n\nNow, she could say she was completely stress-free.  \n\nThe Mother’s favorability toward her had already reached 70%!  \n\nOnce it exceeded 65%, the [Blessing] benefit would activate.  \n\nEven if she failed a Mission once or twice, it would only lower her favorability slightly—there’d be no Punishment at all.\n\nAnd when the favorability reaches 100%, the [Perfect Strategy] achievement will be unlocked, freeing you from the daily nerve-wracking missions.  \n\nA successfully \"strategized\" Supernatural Entity will no longer pose a risk of turning hostile. In fact, if you provoke other supernatural tenants, they might even step in to shield you from harm.  \n\nOnly at that point can the little apartment truly be considered a safe haven.  \n\nThis is also why Liu Yitong and Dong Chu exhaust themselves daily to complete tasks, striving to satisfy their supernatural family members to the fullest.  \n\nWithout strategizing, survival in this instance is nearly impossible!  \n\nIt’s eerily similar to a dating sim game.  \n\n\"Don’t worry, the Grandmother is much kinder than the Father. Though she doesn’t have much fondness for male players, she won’t deliberately target you,\" Liu Yitong reminded Ji Yan.  \n\nShe was terrified that Ji Yan might impulsively lash out and take down the Grandmother Supernatural Entity too!  \n\nAll the effort she’d poured into winning the Grandmother’s favor would then go to waste.  \n\n\"Relax.\"  \n\n\"I’m aiming to strategize as well. If we wipe out all the supernatural family members in Apartment 404, it’d be no different from a broken home.\"  \n\nJi Yan knew what she was thinking—did she really see him as some reckless brute who solved everything with violence?  \n\nWithout further discussion, the two parted ways and entered their respective supernatural family members’ rooms.  \n\nThe Grandmother’s room retained an old-fashioned aesthetic, with many objects bearing the marks of time. The air carried a faint sour cotton scent from knitted fabrics.  \n\nOn the bed, the Grandmother sat, weaving a sweater in her hands, with a small mountain of finished ones piled beside her.  \n\nTo her, it seemed there were always more sweaters to knit.  \n\n\"Child, though this is our first meeting, you’re much more pleasant to look at than that noisy boy,\" the Grandmother remarked, her eyelids drooping slightly.  \n\nJi Yan knew she was referring to Dong Chu. Poor guy—even after getting eliminated, he was still getting dragged.  \n\nFailing at both human and supernatural relations, surviving over twenty days was nothing short of a miracle.  \n\n\"I wholeheartedly agree with you, Grandmother.\"  \n\nSo far, the Grandmother Supernatural Entity did seem far easier to interact with compared to that hyper-aggressive Father…  \n\n\"Here, help thread this for me. My eyes aren’t what they used to be.\"  \n\nThe Grandmother handed him a needle and thread.  \n\nJi Yan took it—his eyesight was decent, and he managed to thread it on the first try.  \n\n\"I won’t ask how you dealt with your father. If I could leave this room, I’d have crushed that ungrateful wretch’s skull myself.\"  \n\n\"Back then, several of my dear granddaughters were taken by that beast and traded to that fox spirit in Room 101 as payment for liquor!\"  \n\n\"You’ve done me a great kindness.\"  \n\nHer voice was hoarse as she spoke.  \n\nFrom this, it was clear that the supernatural beings in Apartment 404 harbored deep grudges against one another. Like the players, they were merely playing their assigned roles.  \n\nNo wonder, after killing the Nightmare Devourer, he’d gained an instant 20% favorability boost from both the Grandmother and the Mother.  \n\n\"Would you like me to dote on you even more? I have two heart knots. Untie even one, and in this apartment—aside from the landlord—no one who steps into 404 will be able to lay a finger on you.\"  \n\nHeart knots!  \n\nAt the keyword, Ji Yan’s eyebrows twitched.  \n\nA small portion of supernatural entities carried heart knots. Resolving one guaranteed at least a 50% favorability increase!  \n\n\"What heart knots do you have, Grandmother?\" Ji Yan ventured to ask.\n\nThe Grandmother Supernatural Entity asked, \"Have you met your mother yet?\"  \n\n\"Once.\"  \n\n\"Kill her. As long as she disappears from Room 404, Grandma will dote on you alone from now on.\"  \n\nThe grandmother set down her knitting, her eyes narrowing as she smiled kindly.  \n\nJi Yan: \"...\"  \n\nHe should’ve known it wouldn’t be that easy.  \n\n\"Fine, I won’t make it hard for you.\"  \n\nThe grandmother casually tossed over a sachet and continued knitting. \"Take this sachet to Room 605.\"  \n\n\"Whether they accept it or not doesn’t matter—just deliver it.\"  \n\n\"When you come back, Grandma will personally knit you a sweater.\"  \n\n\"You’re the first boy I’ve ever knitted for.\"  \n\nShe raised her kindly face. \"This benefit isn’t something just any grandmother would give. It’s only because you did a great deed last night.\"  \n\nJi Yan froze slightly.  \n\nHe looked at the sachet handed to him.  \n\nEmbroidered on it were the words Suisui Ping’an.\n\nThis simple?\n\nJi Yan couldn’t suppress the twitch of his lips. Wasn’t this just a freebie mission?\n\nLiu Yitong also had a sweater knitted by the grandmother.  \n\nFrom the information Ji Yan had gathered, it was guaranteed to be at least Rare-grade.  \n\nWearing it granted 30% immunity to supernatural damage—a literal bulletproof vest.  \n\n\"Don’t worry, Grandma. I’ll definitely deliver it.\"  \n\nJi Yan took it. Only an idiot would refuse such an easy errand.\n\nThe grandmother chuckled and resumed her knitting.  \n\nOnly after Ji Yan left the room did the sachet trigger his Talent, revealing a hidden information panel:  \n\n\"The sachet is one of the foundational materials for 'Building the Apartment.' To sew it, the grandmother spent half a month’s effort, even ruining three sets of needles and thread. Guess why this dilapidated apartment still stands unshaken in the Eerie World?\"\n\nJi Yan glanced at the panel, puzzled.  \n\nBuilding the Apartment.\n\nSo this sachet is construction material for the apartment?\n\nThe hidden information was cryptic and vague.  \n\nJi Yan shook his head, dismissing it.  \n\nIn the end, all that mattered was delivering it. What the sachet was for or where it came from had nothing to do with him.\n\nJust as he closed the information panel, Liu Yitong emerged from the opposite room, holding an empty soy sauce bottle.  \n\n\"Seriously? Another soy sauce mission? Does this Mother Supernatural Entity just chug soy sauce?\"  \n\nThe moment he saw the bottle, Ji Yan couldn’t help but complain.  \n\nThis was the perk of high favorability!\n\nFor the same mission reward, others had to risk their lives circling the gates of hell, barely scraping by to complete it—while Liu Yitong just went downstairs to buy soy sauce and called it a day.  \n\nWho wouldn’t be jealous seeing that?\n\nLiu Yitong scratched her head, a little embarrassed.  \n\nThe Mother Supernatural Entity’s favoritism was indeed too obvious.  \n\nShe deflected by asking, \"What’s your mission today?\"  \n\n\"The mission panel didn’t even pop up. The grandmother just gave me this sachet.\"  \n\nJi Yan held up the Suisui Ping’an sachet.\n\nYet the moment Liu Yitong saw it, her pretty face paled slightly...",

    "content": "第16章主线人物，公寓房东\n\n纪言注意到了刘艺桐脸色的不对：“看你表情，香囊有问题？”\n刘艺桐张了张嘴，最终说了一句：“这香囊，涉及公寓的主线。”\n“主线任务？”\n纪言面色微变，接着任务面板终于弹了出来。\n“叮！玩家收下奶奶的香囊，触发A级任务，请将香囊送至605房间，即可完成任务。”\n（提示：任务涉及主线人物，任务过程中，有一定概率出现不可控危险，切忌谨慎）\n纪言眉头一皱。\n那老太婆说好的简单轻松任务，结果到头来是个A级，还涉及主线！\n主线任务，不仅仅是危险程度最高，还牵扯公寓的所有住户。\n完成了即可直接通关整个副本。\n可要是任务失败了，就是得罪所有诡异住客，面对数不尽的诡异黑化。\n这种例子太多了。\n例如曾经的一个餐厅副本，就有玩家挑战主线，结果玩砸了，导致整个餐厅的食材全部报废，造成不可估计的损失，下场可想而知。\n死都是一种奢望。\n所以一般玩家，没有充足装备和信心下，都不想沾上主线这种晦气东西。\n就算意外得到了一些涉及主线的道具提示，也跟赶忙扔掉，生怕沾上一点。\n“你是不是惹诡异奶奶生气了？”\n刘艺桐忍不住问。\n纪言：“从头到尾，她夸我的嘴角都没垂下来过。”\n“还说送了这香囊，转头给我亲自编织一件毛衣。”\n刘艺桐讶然，一时间也懵了。\n跟奶奶打过不少交道的她，也不明白第一次互动，为什么会针对纪言。\n难道真自带什么仇恨体质？\n“涉及而已，又不是进入主线。”\n“走了，晚上见。”\n纪言摆摆手，诡他都干掉一只了，一个涉及主线也不至于吓得不敢出门。\n从404房间出来，纪言率先去了7楼。\n毕竟自己的心脏，还当筹码押在别人那里。\n敲了敲702房间门，还是没有锁。\n纪言推门而进，刚步入客厅，就看见702户主躺在藤椅上，闭目养神。\n那一黑一白两只猫躺在他怀里，睡的很香。\n“我父亲……”\n“死了，我知道。”\n纪言话未说完，702户主就打断了：“那死酒鬼一死，公寓里那股臭酒味就散去了。”\n“我不知道你怎么办到的，但胆魄确实有。”\n“心脏在盒子里，拿回去吧。”\n“至于那把柴刀，也归你了。”\n纪言打开盒子，自己的心脏保持着鲜活的生命。\n紧接着，关于702户主的信息面板弹出在视线中：\n“叮！恭喜玩家完成702住客心愿任务，获得“怨念诡”70%好感度，你将获得该诡异住客的帮助，可以提出一定范围内的要求。”\n“70%好感度？”\n纪言暗惊。\n就一个任务，就干到了70%的好感度？\n转念一想，这是只怨念诡，怨念的源头就是杀妻之仇，仇结了，好感度瞬飙70似乎也在合理之中。\n“我欠你一个人情。”\n“在公寓里有什么麻烦，可以来找我。”\n“在这个公寓里，我还有不少份量的。”\n刘念青缓缓开口。\n平淡的一句话，对玩家而言，却已经是最大的奖励！\n获得一位诡异住客作为靠山，玩家在副本生存的概率，至少大幅度提升。\n纪言一听，心说这不巧了吗。\n“还真有一件事拜托一下。”\n刘念青直接问：“干谁？”\n纪言：“……”\n“暂时不用干谁，只是想问问这个香囊，叔你认识吗？”\n纪言取出了那个红香囊。\n刘念青见着香囊，脸色顿时跟吃了苍蝇一样。\n纪言问：“咋了？”\n刘念青：“我想收回刚才那句话。”\n“……”\n“你这香囊，是房东的东西，如果你是想让我干房东……那你还是把我干掉吧。”\n纪言表情凝重。\n根据公寓副本的背景介绍，房东多半就是副本最大Boss，诡异奶奶怎么会有他的东西？\n看着手心里的香囊，纪言越看越觉得像块烫手芋头，恨不得当场扔了。\n“放心，我跟房东没仇。”\n“主要想问问香囊，有什么来历？”\n“我只知道，这东西是房东的一个贴身物品。”\n“但前阵子，香囊烂了，所以交给你奶奶缝补。”\n“你奶奶交给你，是让你还给房东？”刘念青猜到了缘由。\n“嗯”纪言点点头。\n这样看来，只是归还缝补好的香囊，并不会有什么危险。\n刘艺桐和他都太敏感了，一听到主线，就感觉天都塌了。\n“你送过去的时候，别多嘴，最好全程沉默。”\n“房东性格古怪，脾气不好，一个不爽就会涨租金。”\n“如果给住客们知道，房东是因为你涨租金，会把你撕的干干净净，我也保不住你。”刘念青提醒道。\n纪言眼皮跳了跳。\n“涨点租金这么大反应？”\n“那个所谓的租金，哪怕涨一点，住客们也得抓狂，包括我。”\n刘念青靠着藤椅，缓缓开口，又带着叹息。\n“这栋公寓，不是谁都能住的，我们能成为这里的住客，都付出了不轻的代价，这个代价就是租金。”\n所谓的租金究竟是什么，最后没有明说，纪言从702房间，就往605去了。\n他对房东、租金都不感兴趣。\n知道越多，涉及主线越深。\n最后深陷万丈深渊，爬都爬不出来。\n很快，他敲响了605的房间。\n开门的是一个身形佝偻的老头。\n纪言眨眨眼，这是房东？看着挺慈眉善目的，但刘念青字里行间，都透着对房东的惧怕。\n老头子：“小伙子，有事？”\n“我住404，奶奶让我送上来的。”\n老头子拿起香囊，\n纪言取出香囊，递交上去。\n诡老头瞥了眼，摇摇头：“拿回去吧。”\n“那老太婆没缝好，她的针线活越来越差劲了。”\n纪言谨记诡异奶奶交代的话，收不收是另一回事，只要送到就行。\n“好。”纪言只回了一个字，掉头就走。\n他只是一个跑腿的，管那么多做什么。\n“等等！”\n但刚转身，纪言就又被喊住，诡老头盯着纪言：“我让你拿回去你真拿回去啊？”\n说完，他一手夺过香囊，仔细打量片刻，又称赞道：“还不错，那老太婆手越来越巧了。”\n纪言嘴角一抽。\n刘念青说的一点没错，这房东老头子真的有点毛病，一会儿一个样，难不成有双重人格？\n“香囊我收下了，你跟你奶奶说，这个月的租金，抵消了。”",
    "translatedContent": "Chapter 16: Main Storyline Character, The Landlord  \n\nJi Yan noticed the change in Liu Yitong’s expression. \"Judging by your face, is there something wrong with the sachet?\"  \n\nLiu Yitong hesitated before finally saying, \"This sachet is tied to the apartment’s main storyline.\"  \n\n\"Main Storyline Task?\"  \n\nJi Yan’s expression shifted slightly as the Information Panel finally popped up.  \n\nDing! Player has accepted the Grandmother Supernatural Entity’s sachet, triggering an A-grade task. Deliver the sachet to Room 605 to complete the mission.\n\n(Hint: This task involves a main storyline character. During the mission, there is a certain probability of encountering uncontrollable dangers. Proceed with extreme caution.)\n\nJi Yan frowned.  \n\nThat old woman promised a simple, easy task, but it turned out to be an A-grade mission involving the main storyline!  \n\nMain Storyline Tasks weren’t just the most dangerous—they also implicated every resident in the apartment. Completing one meant clearing the entire instance outright.  \n\nBut failing? That meant offending every Supernatural Entity tenant and facing endless waves of corrupted entities.  \n\nThere were too many examples of this.  \n\nLike that one restaurant instance where a player challenged the main storyline, messed up, and caused all the restaurant’s ingredients to spoil, resulting in incalculable losses. The outcome?  \n\nDeath would’ve been a mercy.  \n\nThat’s why most players, unless fully equipped and confident, avoided the main storyline like the plague. Even if they accidentally stumbled upon a main storyline-related item or clue, they’d toss it away immediately, terrified of getting involved.  \n\n\"Did you piss off the Grandmother Supernatural Entity?\" Liu Yitong couldn’t help but ask.  \n\nJi Yan: \"From start to finish, she never stopped smiling at me.\"  \n\n\"She even said that after delivering this sachet, she’d personally knit me a sweater.\"  \n\nLiu Yitong was stunned, momentarily speechless.  \n\nDespite her many dealings with the Grandmother, she couldn’t understand why the old woman would take such a liking to Ji Yan on their first interaction.  \n\nWas he really born with some kind of grudge-attracting constitution?  \n\n\"It’s just related to the main storyline, not actually diving into it.\"\n\n\"See you tonight.\"  \n\nJi Yan waved her off. He’d already taken down one Supernatural Entity—just being involved with the main storyline wasn’t enough to scare him into hiding.  \n\nLeaving Room 404, Ji Yan headed straight for the 7th floor.  \n\nAfter all, his heart was still being held as collateral.  \n\nHe knocked on the door of Room 702—still unlocked—and pushed it open.  \n\nStepping into the living room, he saw the resident of Room 702 reclining on a rattan chair, eyes closed in repose.  \n\nThe one black and one white cat lay curled in his arms, fast asleep.  \n\n\"My father—\"  \n\n\"Dead. I know.\"  \n\nThe resident of Room 702 cut him off before he could finish. \"The stench of alcohol in the apartment vanished the moment that drunkard died.\"  \n\n\"I don’t know how you pulled it off, but you’ve got guts.\"  \n\n\"Your heart’s in the box. Take it back.\"  \n\n\"As for that Rusted Hatchet, it’s yours now.\"  \n\nJi Yan opened the box. His heart pulsed with vitality, perfectly preserved.  \n\nThen, the resident’s Information Panel appeared in his vision:  \n\nDing! Congratulations, Player, for completing the Resident of Room 702’s wish task. You’ve gained 70% favorability with the \"Resentful Supernatural Entity.\" You may now request assistance from this Supernatural Entity tenant within certain limits.\n\n\"70% favorability?\"  \n\nJi Yan was inwardly shocked.  \n\nJust one task, and he’d already hit 70%?\n\nAfter a moment's thought, it made sense—this was a Resentful Supernatural Entity, and the source of its resentment was the murder of its wife. With the grudge resolved, the favorability shooting up to 70% seemed perfectly reasonable.  \n\n\"I owe you a favor.\"  \n\n\"If you run into trouble in the apartment, you can come to me.\"  \n\n\"I carry some weight around here.\"  \n\nLiu Nianqing spoke slowly.  \n\nA simple statement, but for a Player, it was the greatest reward imaginable!  \n\nGaining a Supernatural Entity resident as a backer meant the Player's survival odds in the instance had skyrocketed.  \n\nHearing this, Ji Yan thought to himself, What a coincidence.\n\n\"There actually is something I’d like to ask for your help with.\"  \n\nLiu Nianqing cut straight to the point: \"Who do you want dead?\"  \n\nJi Yan: \"...\"  \n\n\"Not that, for now. I just wanted to ask—do you recognize this sachet, Uncle?\"  \n\nJi Yan took out the red sachet.  \n\nThe moment Liu Nianqing saw it, his face twisted as if he’d swallowed a fly.  \n\nJi Yan asked, \"What’s wrong?\"  \n\nLiu Nianqing: \"I’d like to take back what I just said.\"  \n\n\"...\"  \n\n\"That sachet belongs to the Landlord. If you’re asking me to take him on… you might as well just kill me now.\"  \n\nJi Yan’s expression turned grave.  \n\nAccording to the apartment instance’s background, the Landlord was likely the final boss. How did the Grandmother Supernatural Entity end up with something of his?  \n\nStaring at the sachet in his palm, Ji Yan couldn’t help but feel it was more like a hot potato—he was tempted to toss it away on the spot.  \n\n\"Don’t worry, I don’t have any grudge against the Landlord.\"  \n\n\"I just wanted to ask about the sachet’s origins.\"  \n\n\"All I know is that it’s one of the Landlord’s personal belongings.\"  \n\n\"But a while ago, it got damaged, so he gave it to your grandmother for repairs.\"  \n\n\"Did she give it to you so you could return it to the Landlord?\" Liu Nianqing guessed the reason.  \n\n\"Yeah,\" Ji Yan nodded.  \n\nIn that case, simply returning the repaired sachet shouldn’t pose any danger.  \n\nBoth Liu Yitong and he had overreacted—just hearing the word \"main storyline\" made them feel like the sky was falling.  \n\n\"When you deliver it, don’t say a word. Stay silent the whole time.\"  \n\n\"The Landlord’s temperament is… peculiar. If he’s in a bad mood, he’ll raise the Rent.\"  \n\n\"And if the other residents find out the Rent went up because of you, they’ll tear you to shreds. Even I wouldn’t be able to protect you.\" Liu Nianqing warned.  \n\nJi Yan’s eyelid twitched.  \n\n\"A Rent hike causes that much of a reaction?\"\n\n\"That so-called Rent—even the slightest increase drives the residents insane. Myself included.\"  \n\nLeaning back in his rattan chair, Liu Nianqing spoke slowly, sighing as he did.  \n\n\"Not just anyone can live in this apartment. All of us who became residents here paid a heavy price—that price is the Rent.\"  \n\nWhat exactly the Rent entailed wasn’t clarified in the end. Ji Yan left Room 702 and headed straight for Room 605.  \n\nHe had no interest in the Landlord or the Rent.  \n\nThe more he knew, the deeper he’d be dragged into the main storyline.  \n\nAnd once he fell into that abyss, there’d be no climbing back out.  \n\nSoon, he knocked on the door of Room 605.  \n\nThe door was opened by a hunched old man.  \n\nJi Yan blinked. This was the Landlord? He looked rather kind and gentle, but Liu Nianqing’s words had been dripping with fear of him.\n\nThe old man: \"Young man, what can I do for you?\"  \n\n\"I live in 404. Grandmother asked me to deliver this.\"  \n\nJi Yan took out the sachet and handed it over.  \n\nThe old man picked it up.\n\nThe Eccentric Old Man glanced at it and shook his head. \"Take it back.\"  \n\n\"That old hag didn’t sew it properly. Her needlework is getting worse and worse.\"  \n\nJi Yan kept in mind the Grandmother Supernatural Entity’s instructions—whether he accepted it or not was another matter, as long as it was delivered.  \n\n\"Alright.\" Ji Yan replied with just one word before turning to leave.  \n\nHe was just a messenger—why bother with the rest?  \n\n\"Wait!\"  \n\nBut the moment he turned around, Ji Yan was called back. The Eccentric Old Man stared at him. \"You really took me seriously when I told you to take it back?\"  \n\nWith that, he snatched the sachet and examined it carefully before praising, \"Not bad. That old hag’s hands are getting more skillful.\"  \n\nJi Yan’s lips twitched.  \n\nLiu Nianqing was absolutely right—this landlord really had some issues, changing his mind in an instant. Could he have a dual personality?  \n\n\"I’ll keep the sachet. Tell your grandmother that this month’s rent is canceled.\"",

    "content": "第17章公告任务，副本大佬\n\n见香囊被对方收下，纪言打算美滋滋回去交差，领取任务奖励。\n可刚转身，就看见房东拎着一张公告，在楼道口那边贴。\n准备下楼的纪言，在好奇心驱使下，不由自主过去瞅了两眼。\n【重要公告：公寓楼后的水沟槽内，出现一只寄生老鼠，为了维护公寓的良好环境，也为了住客们的权益，需要集齐7名住客，对其进行扫除。】\n【完成扫除任务，所有参与者可获得当月减半租金优惠，组团清扫人员限7人，望周知。】\n纪言看了眼，伸手触碰了一下。\n视线里当即弹出了一块任务面板。\n“叮！你触发自选任务，帮助公寓清扫水沟槽的老鼠，完成任务，可获得所有诡异住客5%好感度。”\n“并且随机抽选一个珍藏级宝箱———50%开出珍藏级别道具，保底100%开出一件稀有级别道具。”\n“提示：任务玩家可自主选择，一旦确定，不可更改。”\n“奖励这么丰厚？”\n先不说当月租金减半。\n单单所有住客获得5%好感度，还有一个宝箱奖励，这诱惑条件就已经堪比A+级任务了！\n纪言微微讶异。\n公告贴出来后，当即把不少住客吸引了过来，但都是玩家住客，显然这则公告并不涉及诡异住客。\n在一个个玩家触碰弹出任务面板后，都瞪大了眼睛。\n奖励高，往往难度和死亡率也高。\n不少人都暗感其中有诈。\n可即使这样，还是有几个玩家不做多考虑接下了这个任务。\n明知山有虎，偏向虎山行。这些玩家脑子不是不知道，只是他们没有选择，如果不是生存环境岌岌可危，谁又愿意铤而走险，赚这种血钱呢？\n纪言本来也不感兴趣。\n除掉魇食诡后，他现在在404小屋，生存环境十分可观。\n没必要这么玩命。\n可紧接着弹出的隐藏信息，又让他停住了脚步。\n【任务隐藏信息：提示玩家，该任务过程中，检测到存在“天赋碎片”，建议玩家积极参与。】\n“天赋碎片什么玩意儿？”\n纪言查看一下。\n发现自己的【全知全解】天赋，居然还能进行升阶，需要的条件就是这所谓的天赋碎片。\n“这个这个bug天赋居然还能升阶？”\n纪言脸色微微愕然。\n接着是仔细斟酌。\n眼看着那则公告，此刻参与的人数已经有6人，还差最后一个名额。\n不知是好奇心驱使，还是本能反应，一咬牙，纪言摘下了公告下夹着的最后一块工作牌。\n摘了工作牌，等同于接下任务，不得再退出！\n虽然【全知全解】的天赋很霸道，但触发的条件还是太生硬了，只能通过触碰相关物品才能触发，某种程度上还是有些苛刻。\n说不定升阶之后会完善这个弊端？\n大不了任务中遇到危险，就把702的刘念青曝出来，当作靠山，毕竟这只诡还欠自己一个人情。\n“不是哥们，这种玩命的苦差事，你也要抢？”\n纪言一确认，一旁的中分男就忍不住来一句。\n他都准备伸手去摘工牌了，结果晚了两秒，给纪言捷足先登了。\n“我为什么是不能接？”纪言反问。\n“别逗了，你看你脸红润有色，身体健全，一看生存环境就很不错，接这种玩命任务，你咋想的？”\n中分男十分不理解。\n副本里，通过外形面貌可以大体看出一个玩家的生存环境。\n例如玩家一到三天不进食，脸色会明显枯瘦，三到七天不进食，身体暴瘦不说，身体还会浮现尸斑。\n饥饿、睡眠不足等等，会使得玩家的状态各项数值下降。\n而玩家之间靠近，是可以查看最基本的状态数值。\n对方一点开纪言的状态数值，全是饱满的。\n好家伙，生存环境这么好，还接这种玩命的任务，来给自己找罪受，这是有什么大毛病？\n纪言则是看了眼他后方，说道：“你身后那个条件不比我更好？”\n后方，一个爆炸头的男子也摘了工牌。\n他穿着光鲜，体型高大魁梧。\n仔细一看，身上穿的衣物，以及佩戴的首饰，居然都是诡物道具，腰间挂着的那把菜刀，怨念浓烈，一看等级就不低。\n这就好比在新手村里，冒出一个满身神级装备，还自带坐骑的满级大佬。\n纪言点开对方的主页公开信息，脸色也是一变。\n“玩家：龙元。”\n“副本生存时间：109天。”\n“副本进程：已完成一条主线，诡异住客攻略12名，淘汰4名。”\n“装备：未公开。”\n“状态：六项数值饱满。”（六边形）\n这华丽的主页，就是纪言也惊住了，更别说其余侧目看过来的玩家。\n一个个瞪大了眼睛：“卧槽，这是真大佬啊！”\n只有小部分的老玩家，默默收回目光，心头惊讶：“这家伙睡了这么多天，今天居然出屋了！”\n龙元摘了工牌，嚼着口香糖看了几眼，转身便下楼，丝毫不在意周围诧异的目光。\n中分男见对方的背影离去后，才扭头对纪言说道：“人家那大佬是冲着主线任务去的，跟咱们不一样。”\n“你生存没几天吧，龙神都不认识，猩红公寓生存时间最长的玩家，这大佬老早就把公寓攻略下来了，上一条主线就是被他刷新的。”\n“你肯定想问，副本都刷通了，为什么不去下一个副本？人家……”\n“我没问，也不想问。”\n中分男显然是那龙元的迷弟，正说的起劲，就被纪言摆手打断，转身离开。\n他对这些所谓的大佬兴趣不大，了解了又怎样，人家又不会分块肉给你。\n从楼道下来，纪言没有回404小屋，直接到了一楼汇合。\n清扫小队一旦满员，即刻出发，天黑之前不管能否完成，都必须回来。\n公寓门口大厅，已经集齐满人，纪言是最后一个到。\n七人小队，有五个脸色枯黄消瘦，如中分男所说，参加这个公告任务的多数都处于被淘汰边缘，都想着靠这个任务博一线生机。\n本来每个人都忐忑不安。\n公寓外的浓雾密布，什么未知危险都无法预测。\n但在看到龙元下来后，每个人的脸色突然又180度转变了。\n龙元居然也在这个任务里！\n那这个扫除水沟槽的任务，拿下就是板上钉钉的事了。\n虽然功劳分配，龙元肯定占大头，但被带飞下，能分到一杯羹，他们也满足了。\n面对周围投来的目光，身材高大的龙元没有去看，戴着头戴式耳机，拿着一本书，嚼着口香糖，沉浸在自己的世界里。\n这个画面形成了两个极端的反差。\n周围人宛如从贫民窟里营养不良的难民，唯独龙元从富人区里过来度假一般。\n纪言拿出一块小麦面包塞进嘴里，盯着不远处的龙元，嘴里吐出一句：“怎么感觉这么装？”\n刚说完，那龙元突然摘下头戴式耳机，看了过来。\n察觉对方看的是自己，纪言面色微愕：“不是吧，戴着耳机都能听见？”",
    "translatedContent": "Chapter 17: Announcement Mission, The Dungeon Expert  \n\nSeeing the sachet accepted, Ji Yan prepared to return triumphantly to claim his mission rewards. But as soon as he turned around, he spotted the Landlord posting an announcement by the stairwell.  \n\nDriven by curiosity, Ji Yan, who had been about to head downstairs, couldn’t help but take a closer look.  \n\n[Important Announcement: A Parasitic Rat has appeared in the drainage ditch behind the apartment building. To maintain a clean environment and protect the rights of residents, seven tenants are required to assemble for its extermination.]\n\n[Upon completing the cleaning task, all participants will receive a 50% rent reduction for the current month. The team is limited to seven members. Please take note.]\n\nJi Yan glanced at it and reached out to touch the notice. Instantly, a mission panel popped into view.  \n\n\"Ding! You’ve triggered an optional mission: Assist the apartment in cleaning the drainage ditch of rats. Upon completion, all Supernatural Entity tenants’ favorability toward you will increase by 5%.\"\n\n\"Additionally, a Collector's Grade Treasure Chest will be randomly awarded—50% chance of containing a Collector's Grade item, with a guaranteed 100% chance of at least one Rare-grade item.\"\n\n\"Note: This mission is optional for Players. Once confirmed, it cannot be changed.\"\n\n\"Such generous rewards?\"  \n\nForget the 50% rent reduction—just the 5% favorability boost from all residents and the treasure chest reward alone made this comparable to an A+ rank mission!  \n\nJi Yan was mildly astonished.  \n\nAs soon as the announcement was posted, it drew the attention of many tenants—though all of them were Players, clearly indicating that this notice didn’t concern the Supernatural Entity residents.  \n\nOne by one, Players touched the notice, and their eyes widened as the mission panel appeared before them.  \n\nHigh rewards often came with high difficulty and mortality rates.  \n\nMany secretly suspected a trap.  \n\nYet, even so, several Players accepted the mission without much hesitation.  \n\n\"They know the mountain has tigers, yet they march toward it.\" These Players weren’t ignorant—they simply had no choice. If their survival wasn’t hanging by a thread, who would risk their lives for such bloody rewards?\n\nJi Yan hadn’t been interested at first.  \n\nAfter eliminating the Nightmare Devourer, his living conditions in Room 404 were more than stable.  \n\nThere was no need to gamble like this.  \n\nBut then, a hidden message popped up, stopping him in his tracks.  \n\n[Mission Hidden Information: Players are advised that ‘Talent Fragments’ have been detected during this mission. Active participation is recommended.]\n\n\"What the hell are Talent Fragments?\"  \n\nJi Yan checked and discovered that his [Omniscient Understanding] Talent could actually be upgraded—and the required material was these so-called Talent Fragments.\n\n\"This bug-like Talent can be upgraded further?\"  \n\nA look of surprise flickered across Ji Yan’s face.  \n\nHe weighed his options carefully.  \n\nBy now, six people had already signed up for the mission, leaving only one slot remaining.  \n\nWhether it was curiosity or instinct, he gritted his teeth and took the last work badge clipped beneath the notice.  \n\nTaking the badge meant accepting the mission—no backing out now!  \n\nThough [Omniscient Understanding] was overpowered, its activation conditions were still too rigid—it only triggered upon touching relevant objects, which was somewhat restrictive.\n\nPerhaps upgrading it would fix this flaw?\n\nIf things get dangerous during the mission, he could always expose Liu Nianqing from Room 702 as his backer—after all, that supernatural entity owed him a favor.  \n\n\"Seriously, dude? You’re fighting for this kind of life-risking grunt work too?\"  \n\nThe moment Ji Yan confirmed his participation, Middle-Part Man couldn’t help but interject.  \n\nHe had already reached for the work badge, but he was two seconds too late—Ji Yan had beaten him to it.  \n\n\"Why can’t I take it?\" Ji Yan shot back.  \n\n\"Don’t joke around. Look at you—rosy cheeks, healthy body, clearly living in great conditions. What kind of masochist takes on a suicide mission like this?\"  \n\nMiddle-Part Man was utterly baffled.  \n\nIn this instance, a player’s living conditions could generally be deduced from their appearance.  \n\nFor example, if a player went without food for one to three days, their face would visibly wither. Three to seven days without eating, and not only would their body become emaciated, but corpse spots would also start appearing.  \n\nHunger, sleep deprivation, and the like would cause a player’s stats to drop across the board.  \n\nAnd when players got close enough, they could check each other’s most basic status values.  \n\nThe moment Middle-Part Man pulled up Ji Yan’s stats, every single one was maxed out.  \n\nDamn, living this comfortably and still signing up for a death mission? What kind of lunatic was this?  \n\nJi Yan, however, glanced behind him and said, \"Isn’t the guy behind me in even better shape?\"  \n\nThere, a man with a wild afro had also taken a work badge.  \n\nHe was dressed sharply, tall and burly.  \n\nA closer look revealed that his clothes and accessories were all supernatural artifact equipment. The cleaver hanging at his waist radiated such intense resentment that its high level was obvious at a glance.  \n\nIt was like stumbling upon a max-level player decked out in god-tier gear—complete with a mount—in a beginner’s village.  \n\nWhen Ji Yan opened the man’s publicly available profile, his expression shifted.  \n\n\"Player: Long Yuan.\"\n\n\"Instance Survival Time: 109 days.\"\n\n\"Instance Progress: Completed one main storyline, interacted with 12 supernatural entity residents, eliminated 4.\"\n\n\"Equipment: Undisclosed.\"\n\n\"Status: All six attributes maxed out.\" (Hexagon)\n\nThe sheer opulence of this profile stunned even Ji Yan, let alone the other players who turned to look.  \n\nEyes widened in shock. \"Holy shit, this is the real deal!\"  \n\nOnly a handful of veteran players silently averted their gazes, thinking in astonishment, \"This guy’s been holed up for days—and he actually came out today?\"\n\nLong Yuan pocketed his work badge, chewed his gum for a moment, then headed downstairs without a care for the stunned stares around him.  \n\nOnly after Long Yuan’s figure disappeared did Middle-Part Man turn back to Ji Yan and say, \"That big shot’s here for the main storyline mission. He’s not like us.\"  \n\n\"You must be new here if you don’t even know Dragon God—the player with the longest survival time in Crimson Apartment. This legend conquered the place ages ago. The last main storyline was cleared by him.\"  \n\n\"You’re probably wondering, if he’s already beaten the instance, why hasn’t he moved on to the next one? Well, he—\"  \n\n\"I didn’t ask, and I don’t care.\"  \n\nMiddle-Part Man was clearly a fanboy, but Ji Yan cut him off with a wave and walked away.  \n\nHe had little interest in so-called legends. What was the point of knowing? It wasn’t like they’d share a piece of the pie with him.  \n\nInstead of returning to his Room 404, Ji Yan headed straight to the first-floor lobby to regroup.\n\nThe cleaning squad would depart as soon as it was fully assembled, with the strict rule of returning before nightfall regardless of completion.  \n\nAt the apartment lobby, the team had already gathered, and Ji Yan was the last to arrive.  \n\nThe seven-member squad included five who looked sallow and emaciated, just as Middle-Part Man had said—most participants were on the brink of elimination, pinning their hopes on this mission for a lifeline.  \n\nOriginally, everyone was uneasy.  \n\nThe thick fog outside the apartment obscured any potential dangers, making the unknown impossible to predict.  \n\nBut the moment Long Yuan descended, the mood shifted dramatically.  \n\nLong Yuan was actually part of this mission!  \n\nWith him on board, clearing the Drainage Ditch was as good as done.  \n\nThough Long Yuan would undoubtedly claim the lion’s share of the rewards, the others were content just to ride his coattails and secure a small portion for themselves.  \n\nIgnoring the gazes around him, the tall and imposing Long Yuan remained absorbed in his own world—wearing over-ear headphones, flipping through a book, and chewing gum.  \n\nThe scene painted a stark contrast.  \n\nWhile the others looked like malnourished refugees from the slums, Long Yuan appeared as though he had strolled in from a wealthy district for a leisurely vacation.  \n\nJi Yan stuffed a piece of wheat bread into his mouth, staring at Long Yuan from a distance before muttering, \"Why does he have to act so pretentious?\"  \n\nNo sooner had the words left his mouth than Long Yuan suddenly removed his headphones and looked straight at him.  \n\nRealizing the gaze was directed at him, Ji Yan’s expression flickered with surprise. \"No way… He could hear me even with headphones on?\"",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 18: Nourishing the Blade with Blood, Toying with Human Hearts  \n\nAs Long Yuan stared at him, Ji Yan swallowed the last bite of his bread and was about to speak when a voice sounded from behind: \"Once the door opens, follow me and don’t stray more than 10 steps away.\"  \n\n\"The fog outside is thick. If you get lost, don’t even think about returning to the apartment.\"  \n\nBehind them stood a bandage-wrapped supernatural entity, its body entirely swathed in bandages save for a pair of bloodshot eyes. A work badge hung from its chest, bearing the words \"Apartment Manager.\"  \n\nThe Bandaged Supernatural Entity showed no kindness toward Ji Yan and the others, its words dripping with disdain and disgust for these outsider tenants.  \n\n\"How big is that 'rat'?\"  \n\nLong Yuan, who had just removed his earphones, abruptly asked.  \n\nFacing Long Yuan, the Bandaged Supernatural Entity instantly changed its tone: \"Ah, Mr. Long! I didn’t see you there earlier. Where have you been these past few days?\"  \n\nLong Yuan yawned. \"Sleeping.\"  \n\n\"Mr. Long works tirelessly day and night for the apartment. You deserve a good rest.\"  \n\nThe other players reacted differently to the Bandaged Supernatural Entity’s two-faced behavior. Some silently cursed the manager for being a bootlicker, while others were in awe of Long Yuan.  \n\nAfter all, which player could command such flattery from supernatural entities in the Eerie World?  \n\nLong Yuan yawned again. \"You still haven’t answered my question.\"  \n\nThe Bandaged Supernatural Entity replied, \"The rat was discovered yesterday. It’s quite large—looks like it’s been parasitizing for a while.\"  \n\n\"The Landlord finds these things particularly troublesome. He posted an announcement today, demanding they be eradicated within a day.\"  \n\n\"If Mr. Long joins the cleanup, it shouldn’t be too difficult.\"  \n\nJi Yan listened quietly, his eyes narrowing slightly.  \n\nJust what kind of \"rat\" were they talking about?  \n\nThe Bandaged Supernatural Entity took out a key and unlocked the apartment door.  \n\n\"Whooosh—!!\"  \n\nAs the door opened, a frigid wind howled in, like the wails of countless vengeful spirits, raising goosebumps on everyone’s skin.  \n\nThe group shivered violently.  \n\nThe Bandaged Supernatural Entity walked ahead, its voice icy as it addressed Ji Yan and the others: \"Stay close. If anyone tries to flee, the punishment will be having their legs chopped off and being thrown into the fog.\"  \n\n\"The things in the fog eat everything.\"  \n\n\"They prefer to take their time, and to keep their food fresh, they’ll deliberately avoid vital areas—letting you watch as they devour you.\"  \n\nIts laughter was laced with mockery, relishing the players’ pale, terrified expressions.  \n\nThe intimidation worked. Once outside the apartment, the players clung to the Bandaged Supernatural Entity as if their lives depended on it.  \n\nEerie chewing sounds occasionally echoed through the thick fog, accompanied by the unsettling sensation of countless eyes watching them.  \n\nTwo minutes later, the cleaning squad arrived at the rear building of the Crimson Apartment under the entity’s lead.  \n\nAfter passing through an alley littered with rotting flesh and garbage, the team came upon a filthy, stinking drainage ditch.  \n\nThe ditch was overflowing with trash, and hordes of rats—each as large as an adult tabby cat—had turned it into their paradise. Their eyes were blood-red as they gnawed on unidentified corpses.  \n\nThe female players nearly fainted from terror.  \n\nThe male players trembled as they clutched their cleaning tools.  \n\nWait—were these mutated rats really not going to eat them?  \n\n\"There are way too many rats here!\"\n\n\"Never mind clearing it—we’d be lucky not to become food ourselves!\"  \n\nThough they had braced themselves, the players couldn’t help but break down at the sight before them.  \n\nThe drainage ditch stretched over twenty meters, teeming with countless rats!  \n\n\"I’m only here to guide you.\"  \n\n\"Clearing it is your job.\"  \n\nThe Bandaged Supernatural Entity retreated to the back, its gaze indifferent, as if the matter had nothing to do with it.  \n\nShivering in the cold wind, the players all turned their eyes to Long Yuan.  \n\nAt this moment, Long Yuan had clearly become their only hope!  \n\nNoticing their desperate stares, Long Yuan’s face twisted with disgust: \"I took this mission to advance the main storyline.\"  \n\n\"I’m not here to save you worthless lot.\"  \n\nThe other players fell silent at his words.  \n\nBut since Long Yuan didn’t move, none of them dared to either.  \n\nClearly, they were all prepared to wait it out.  \n\nPerhaps sensing this, Long Yuan changed his tone: \"Unless… you’ve got something valuable on you?\"  \n\nA gaunt, pale-skinned female player huddled in place: \"But if we could afford anything, we wouldn’t be here in the first place.\"  \n\nThen, glancing down at her own body, she looked at Long Yuan: \"...Unless you have… other needs? I can handle that.\"  \n\n\"Women? Hah. In a hellhole like this, flesh is the cheapest commodity.\"  \n\nLong Yuan crossed his arms and sneered, shaking his head.  \n\n\"Then… what do you want?\" a male player asked woodenly.  \n\nSeeing he had them right where he wanted, Long Yuan clapped his hands and revealed his demand: \"Your blood still holds some value.\"  \n\nHe patted the cleaver at his waist: \"This blade of mine needs fresh human blood daily. It’s not easy to maintain.\"  \n\n\"If you take turns nourishing it for a day, I’ll complete this mission for you.\"  \n\n\"It won’t take much—just 1000 milliliters of blood.\"  \n\nThe moment they heard this, their faces turned deathly pale.  \n\n1000 milliliters!  \n\nEven for a healthy person, losing that much blood would be unbearable.  \n\nLet alone for them—malnourished, some already three days without food, showing signs of anemia.  \n\nWasn’t this tantamount to killing them?  \n\nAt the very back, Ji Yan watched Long Yuan’s faint smile and understood something.  \n\nBlood Nourishment for Artifacts!  \n\nLong Yuan had never intended to help them from the start.  \n\nDue to the apartment’s rules, conflict between players was forbidden. Yet his cleaver required fresh human blood to sustain it. Unable to kill or force them directly, he had used this mission to coerce these desperate players into feeding his weapon.  \n\nEven advancing the main storyline was likely just an excuse.  \n\nLosing 1000 milliliters of blood was no different from a slow death.  \n\nJi Yan shook his head.  \n\nThese people were naive—expecting a savior in the Eerie World?  \n\nLong Yuan had survived over a hundred days, nearly clearing the dungeon. Anyone with half a brain could tell he was no saint.  \n\n\"Time’s running out.\"  \n\n\"You have no way out—but I do.\"  \n\n\"I’ve raised the Landlord’s favorability to 60%. Even if I turn back now, I’d only lose a bit of goodwill.\"  \n\n\"Right?\" Long Yuan glanced back at the Bandaged Supernatural Entity.  \n\nThe Bandaged Supernatural Entity replied: \"As a distinguished guest of the apartment, Mr. Long naturally enjoys such privileges.\"\n\nThe players exchanged glances, their faces filled with despair.  \n\nLong Yuan spat out his chewing gum, his eyes gleaming with amusement.  \n\nHaving survived in the Eerie World for so long, he had long since mastered the intricacies of human nature.  \n\nOnly Ji Yan remained silent.  \n\nHe turned to face the endless horde of rats, drew his Rusted Hatchet, and stepped forward.  \n\nA red-eyed rat saw Ji Yan approaching—not only unafraid, but baring its fangs in a vicious, almost human-devouring stance!  \n\nJi Yan acted decisively.  \n\nWith a single step forward, his blade flashed down, piercing through the rat’s body in a spray of blood.  \n\nBeg for help?  \n\nJi Yan never begged.  \n\nThese rats were a plague, impossible to eliminate one by one. If Long Yuan had a way to complete the Mission, then there had to be another method.  \n\nAs for what that method was—  \n\nHis Talent would surely reveal the answer!  \n\nSwinging his Rusted Hatchet, he slaughtered several rats in quick succession.  \n\nBy the time he killed the seventh one, the familiar Hidden Information Panel finally appeared before his eyes...",

It’s impossible.\"  \n\n\"Why not just donate 1000 milliliters of blood with us? Once we get the Mission’s food supply, maybe we can recover after a few days of rest...\"  \n\nThe other Players spoke, though even they didn’t believe their own words.  \n\nJi Yan acted as if he hadn’t heard them, focused solely on killing rats and gathering Hidden Information.  \n\n[Kanjing Gui: A type of Disaster Supernatural Entity that carries a rat plague. It wanders the Eerie World without a fixed dwelling, preferring to infest buildings steeped in resentment. It feeds on vengeful spirits to nourish and expand the plague, strengthening itself in the process.]  \n\n\"Got it!\"  \n\n\"This must be the source entity.\"  \n\nJi Yan’s eyes lit up just as the mutated rats suddenly surged backward, as if drawn by something.  \n\nIn his line of sight, a filthy figure covered in sewage and trash slowly crawled out of the grimy Drainage Ditch.  \n\nThough it resembled a person, it was undeniably a Supernatural Entity.  \n\nOnce it emerged, the mutated rats parted to make way as it dragged itself through the filth toward the base of the apartment wall.  \n\nCrouching down, it began digging with its hands before devouring whatever it unearthed in large, ravenous bites.  \n\nWith each grotesque mouthful, the entire Crimson Apartment trembled violently!  \n\nThe massive structure seethed with dark resentment, as though countless tormented souls wailed within.  \n\nWithin minutes, the Kanjing Gui had gnawed a bowl-sized hole into the wall.  \n\nAs soon as the hole appeared, the mutated rats scrambled inside in a frenzy.  \n\n\"Delicious… so delicious!!\"\n\n\"Delicious! I can't finish it all, it's too tasty!\"  \n\nThe apartment building teetered on the verge of collapse.  \n\nThe mutated rats that had burrowed inside gnawed at anything they could find within the apartment.  \n\nLike termites, they seemed determined to hollow out the entire building.  \n\nStomping a mutated rat into pulp, the Charming Specter from Room 101 on the first floor was the first to suffer, her eyes filled with disgust.  \n\n\"Damn it! Not only is the rent for this apartment outrageously expensive, but they can’t even handle basic sanitation!\"  \n\n\"This is infuriating!\"  \n\nOutside, Cheng Fang was also wailing like a ghost.  \n\n\"Holy shit! These rats are huge! Damn, why are there so many?\"  \n\nThe Charming Specter icily ordered Cheng Fang: \"Don’t let a single rat into my room.\"  \n\n\"If even one gets in, you won’t be staying here anymore.\"  \n\nCheng Fang felt utterly wronged, grumbling internally: \"All the dirty work falls on me—what sins did I commit in my past life?\"  \n\nAs time passed, more and more residents in the apartment voiced their complaints.  \n\nThe landlord swept the hallway, listening to the grievances with a cold snort before projecting his voice outside the apartment: \"Tell them to hurry up and eliminate the rat plague.\"  \n\n\"If they can’t, they don’t need to come back.\"  \n\n\"This apartment never lacks tenants, let alone these pitiful outsiders who can’t even pay rent?\"  \n\nThe Bandaged Supernatural Entity relayed the landlord’s words to the cleaning squad.  \n\nAlready under immense pressure, the squad finally caved in to Long Yuan’s demands.  \n\n\"Long God, I’m willing to help you feed that knife—please, just act now!\"  \n\n\"Me too! Losing a thousand milliliters of blood is better than certain death if we can’t return to the apartment!\"  \n\n\"I’d rather be drained dry than get eaten bite by bite by the Supernatural Entities in the fog!\"  \n\nLong Yuan remained unmoved by their pleas, his gaze fixed on Ji Yan in the distance.  \n\n\"There’s still one left.\"  \n\nThe other players quickly turned to persuade Ji Yan.  \n\nJi Yan flicked the blood off his hands and cast a cold glance at Long Yuan.  \n\n\"Why rely on him?\"  \n\n\"This rat plague was brought by the Kanjing Gui. Kill that thing, and the plague will collapse on its own.\"  \n\nOver there, the Kanjing Gui, gnawing on the apartment building, grew larger with every bite, its once-gaunt body swelling steadily.  \n\nLong Yuan chuckled in surprise. \"You actually know about the Kanjing Gui?\"  \n\n\"True, once the Kanjing Gui dies, the plague will disperse.\"  \n\n\"But it’s like knowing the answer is in the textbook—who here can actually solve it?\"  \n\nLong Yuan rested his hands behind his head.  \n\n\"To kill the Kanjing Gui, you need at least a Collector’s Grade Supernatural Artifact—and that’s only if you know its weakness.\"  \n\n\"Which of you here has that kind of equipment? Who has that kind of confidence?\"  \n\nThe players fell silent.  \n\nA female player whispered to Ji Yan, \"Bro, for everyone’s sake, just give in.\"  \n\n\"Yeah, look at you—you’re in great shape! Losing some blood won’t kill you. We’ve been starving for days, and we’re not complaining!\"  \n\n\"Hurry up and agree! If he leaves, we’re all doomed! Don’t be the rotten apple that spoils the whole barrel!\"  \n\nDriven by survival instinct, the players took turns lecturing Ji Yan—some pleading, others pressuring.  \n\nJust as Ji Yan was about to speak, Long Yuan suddenly changed his mind. \"I’ve reconsidered.\"\n\nHe pointed at Ji Yan: \"You, on top of the basic conditions, have one more thing to add—that Rusted Hatchet belongs to me.\"  \n\n\"Reason?\" Ji Yan countered.  \n\n\"No reason. I just don’t like you.\"  \n\n\"Agree, and I’ll save you all.\"  \n\n\"Refuse, and I walk away right now.\"  \n\nLong Yuan directed all the conflict’s pressure toward Ji Yan, pushing him into the eye of the storm.  \n\nIn this situation, the most desperate were the other Players, who would frantically heap pressure onto Ji Yan.  \n\nIf Long Yuan left, Ji Yan would be the sole scapegoat.  \n\nSo, no matter how unreasonable his demands became, Ji Yan had no choice but to agree.  \n\nWhen it came to manipulating people’s hearts, Long Yuan had plenty of tricks.  \n\nJi Yan saw through it too.  \n\nThis guy was targeting him purely because he had his eyes on the Rusted Hatchet.  \n\nGlancing at the Hidden Information he’d obtained, Ji Yan suddenly thought of something.  \n\n\"What if you can’t kill that Kanjing Gui?\" Ji Yan asked.  \n\n\"Disaster-class Gui like this? I’ve killed at least ten in this dungeon alone.\"  \n\n\"What do you think?\"  \n\nJi Yan: \"There’s always an exception.\"  \n\nLong Yuan, furious, laughed coldly. \"If I fail, this Kitchen Knife of mine is yours!\"  \n\n\"Deal.\"  \n\nSeeing Ji Yan agree so readily, Long Yuan’s expression darkened. He hadn’t expected to be mocked by a rookie in this dungeon.  \n\nHis gaze shifted to the Kanjing Gui in the distance, and a scheme suddenly formed in his mind.  \n\n\"You like betting with me?\"  \n\n\"I’ll make sure you lose completely—not just your Rusted Hatchet, but your life too!\"  \n\nLong Yuan sneered inwardly, his killing intent rising.",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 20: Resentful Supernatural Entity, Sensitive Interaction  \n\nPutting aside his thoughts, Long Yuan stepped forward, feeling the Kitchen Knife at his waist, and strode toward the target.  \n\nThe other Players’ faces lit up with obvious delight.  \n\nNo one cared about the trivial bet—they just wanted to survive.  \n\nYet, in that fleeting moment, Ji Yan caught a glimpse of killing intent in Long Yuan’s eyes.  \n\nNarrowing his gaze slightly, Ji Yan remained silent.  \n\nOver there, the Kanjing Gui continued gnawing at the corner of the apartment, its body gradually swelling into a grotesque mountain of flesh. The gap it tore in the reinforced concrete had already grown as large as a basket.  \n\nStrangely, blood seeped from the broken chunks of cement and bricks it ripped away.  \n\nIt was as if the entire Crimson Apartment had been built from ground-up corpses…  \n\nStepping through the filth and garbage littering the ground, Long Yuan approached the Kanjing Gui.  \n\nHe shouted at it, and as the creature turned its head, the Kitchen Knife slashed down.  \n\nThe bloated head tumbled to the ground, only to be crushed under Long Yuan’s foot.  \n\nThen, flicking the foul fluids off the blade, he turned and walked back.  \n\nThe entire process took less than half a minute.  \n\nThe Players were stunned.  \n\nThis… was too brutal and straightforward. It was like chopping a watermelon.  \n\nLong Yuan twisted his neck and stared at Ji Yan. “Well? Anything to say now?”  \n\nThese Supernatural Entities unrelated to the Instance had no backstory and no lingering resentment.  \n\nWithout those buffs, they were just slightly more terrifying animals—chop off the head, and they’re done.  \n\nEverything he’d said earlier was just to scare these rookies.  \n\nOnly by creating an even more desperate situation could he amplify their will to survive.  \n\nBut Ji Yan suddenly pointed behind him. “I’d say… maybe take a look behind you?”  \n\nLong Yuan turned his head, and his expression froze.  \n\nFrom the Kanjing Gui’s severed neck, a torrent of pitch-black blood gushed out. In an instant, a new head sprouted forth.  \n\nAnd it was even more enraged, rampaging through the apartment with heightened frenzy.  \n\n“Hurts… so much!!”  \n\nAs the hole widened, swarms of Rats scurried into the building.  \n\n“Not dead?!”  \n\nLong Yuan was stunned. The next second, he noticed the blood corroding his Kitchen Knife bit by bit.  \n\nA warning panel immediately popped up.  \n\nDing! Your Supernatural Artifact [Butcher’s Kitchen Knife] has been damaged. Toughness reduced by 30%. Enchanted damage reduced by 55%.\n\nWarning! Your actions have caused property damage to the apartment. The residents are cursing you—12 Supernatural Entity tenants’ favorability toward you has decreased by 7%.\n\nAfter the two warnings appeared, Long Yuan’s face darkened.  \n\nThen, realization struck him as he glared at the Kanjing Gui. “Damn it… this thing isn’t just some random Supernatural Entity, is it? It’s part of the Instance?”  \n\nIf this thing couldn’t be killed, it meant it carried resentment.  \n\nAnd resentment meant it was tied to the Crimson Apartment’s backstory.  \n\nThe most troublesome thing about Resentful Supernatural Entities was their undying nature—as long as the resentment remained, they couldn’t truly perish!  \n\nGrimacing at the damaged Kitchen Knife, Long Yuan felt a pang of frustration.  \n\nHe turned to the Bandaged Supernatural Entity and asked coldly, “What’s this thing’s connection to the apartment?”  \n\nThe Bandaged Supernatural Entity remained silent for a few seconds before answering slowly, “A former resident. Later, it was driven out.”  \n\n“And?”  \n\n“You’ll have to ask the Landlord.”\n\nThe only piece of information obtained from interacting with the Bandaged Supernatural Entity was this:  \n\n\"Bad luck.\"  \n\nLong Yuan sheathed his Kitchen Knife and addressed the administrator, \"Tell the landlord I can’t clear out this rat plague.\"  \n\n\"I quit.\"  \n\nThe Bandaged Supernatural Entity spoke, \"Because of your actions just now, the apartment has suffered losses. The landlord is very unhappy.\"  \n\n\"He says you can quit.\"  \n\n\"Pay three months' rent as compensation.\"  \n\nLong Yuan: \"Three months?!\"  \n\nHe glanced at the Kanjing Gui, his expression turning exceptionally grim, but in the end, he agreed.  \n\nAs a veteran player, he disliked dealing with Resentful Supernatural Entities the most. Eliminating such entities often wasted tremendous effort and consumed a lot of equipment.  \n\nHigh risk, low reward.  \n\nJust one slash had already tanked his favorability with so many supernatural tenants. If he actually killed it, the benefits wouldn’t even cover the losses.  \n\nHe hated nothing more than a losing deal.  \n\nHad he known this mission would be like this, he wouldn’t have come in the first place.  \n\nHe’d missed a step.  \n\nHe forgot to interact with the landlord and accepted the mission without gathering enough information.  \n\nSheathing his Kitchen Knife, Long Yuan turned to leave.  \n\nThe other players panicked when they saw him about to go. \"You promised! You can’t leave!\"  \n\n\"What are we supposed to do if you leave? If necessary, we can extend a few more days and nourish your blade with our blood!\"  \n\nLong Yuan snorted coldly and replied impatiently, \"The Kitchen Knife is damaged, its quality dropped. What the hell do I need your blood for now?\"  \n\n\"Bad luck. Stepped in dogshit the moment I stepped out today.\"  \n\nHe turned to leave but was stopped by Ji Yan’s voice: \"What about our deal?\"  \n\n\"You lost, didn’t you?\"  \n\nLong Yuan looked at Ji Yan and smirked. \"Fine. If you can make it back to the apartment alive, you can have this broken knife.\"  \n\n\"You should worry about surviving this Instance first.\"  \n\nWith those words, Long Yuan vanished into the fog.  \n\nJi Yan didn’t press the matter. He could settle the score later.  \n\nRight now…  \n\nHe needed to focus on the mission. After all this trouble, only a little over two hours remained.  \n\nIgnoring the ashen-faced players, Ji Yan stepped forward and picked up the chunk of the Kanjing Gui’s head that Long Yuan had severed.  \n\nThis was his little scheme.  \n\nThe Kanjing Gui carried too many unknown dangers. Reaching out to touch it directly was too risky.  \n\nThat’s why he’d agreed to Long Yuan’s terms—to let the other man take the risk first, giving him the chance to trigger his Talent and uncover more Hidden Information.  \n\nFrom the very beginning, he’d known from the Hidden Information that this entity carried immense resentment.  \n\nIf killing it in one slash would’ve completed the mission, Long Yuan wouldn’t have even had the chance to draw his blade.  \n\nNow, upon touching the Kanjing Gui, Ji Yan obtained even more Hidden Information.  \n\nDing!\n\nTalent [Omniscient Understanding] successfully triggered. Player has acquired new Hidden Information—\n\n[Kanjing Gui: Former resident of Crimson Apartment, Room 102. Original name: Huang Sheng.]\n\n[Later, due to severe violations of apartment rules, he was expelled. In the thick fog, he was devoured by wandering supernatural entities, resulting in deep-seated resentment that drove him back to the apartment.]\n\n[Hint: The resentment lingers, the spirit remains, neither dead nor destroyed. To break the cycle, you must uncover the source of this resentment.]\n\nJi Yan absorbed the information, his brow furrowing.  \n\nThere was a lot here.  \n\nBut it still wasn’t enough!\n\nHe glanced at the swaying apartment building, then turned his head to look at the Bandaged Supernatural Entity, attempting to continue the interaction.  \n\nHowever, the Bandaged Supernatural Entity was like an NPC with no AI—aside from the single line, \"It was once a resident of the apartment before being driven out,\" there was no further interaction.  \n\n\"Truly just an NPC.\"  \n\nJi Yan shook his head.  \n\nSince the other Supernatural Entities provided no information, he had no choice but to seek answers from the source itself.  \n\nJi Yan walked over, but after the Kanjing Gui was slashed once, the Mutated Rats became abnormally aggressive, refusing to let anyone get close.  \n\n\"Huang Sheng!\"  \n\nJi Yan could only shout the name from a distance, directing it at the Kanjing Gui.  \n\nAs a result, the moment the name was called, the Kanjing Gui grew even more agitated, smashing the corners of the walls with increased ferocity.  \n\n\"WARNING!! Your actions have caused further damage to the apartment. The residents' favorability toward you has dropped. A total of 14 Supernatural Entities now hold hostility toward you!\"  \n\nJi Yan: \"...\"  \n\nHis lips twitched. Just calling out a name could provoke it this much?  \n\nThis Kanjing Gui was like someone with Sensitive Skin—untouchable, unprovokable, the slightest stimulus accelerating its destruction of the apartment building.  \n\nWas this Mission even meant to be playable by humans?  \n\nBut then, Ji Yan noticed something unusual.  \n\nThe Kanjing Gui's dialogue had changed...",

I left something important behind there...\"  \n\n\"Let me in... let me in!\"  \n\nThe Kanjing Gui Huang Sheng let out a hoarse, garbled voice, its tone pleading and resentful. It frantically gnawed at the apartment wall, trying to force its way inside, but its massive body remained stuck.  \n\nJi Yan fell into thought.  \n\nIt seemed the source of the resentment lay within Room 102.  \n\nForcing this Supernatural Entity out wouldn’t work.  \n\nBut what if he helped it find the source of its resentment?  \n\nJi Yan decided it was worth a try—certainly better than brute force.  \n\nHe turned to the Players standing in the mist, resigned to their fate. \"Anyone want to help?\"  \n\n\"Help with what? Even Long Yuan couldn’t kill this thing. What chance do we have?\"  \n\n\"If it gets agitated, it’ll just speed up the destruction of the walls. There’s no way to stop it!\"  \n\nJi Yan shook his head. \"Help it get inside.

He needed help.  \n\nBut no one moved. They all thought he’d lost his mind.  \n\nSeeing no volunteers, Ji Yan sighed, pulled out his Supernatural Nail Hammer, and strode forward, joining the Kanjing Gui in chiseling at the wall.  \n\nThe Mutated Rats around the Kanjing Gui had initially bristled with hostility, but upon seeing his actions, they scattered.  \n\n[Ding! Due to incorrect gameplay actions, the Player has damaged the Instance map, angering the Supernatural tenants. A total of 12 now harbor malice toward you!]\n\nAnother warning panel popped up.  \n\nJi Yan ignored it.  \n\nThey already hated him anyway.  \n\nMalice? So what? He didn’t care.  \n\nGripping the Supernatural Nail Hammer, Ji Yan swung it again and again.  \n\nWith each strike, the wall bled.  \n\nHis eyelids twitched. This apartment hid dark secrets.  \n\nMaybe these bleeding walls were tied to the Main Plot.  \n\n\"He’s really lost it. Does he want to die faster?\"\n\nThe Players behind him broke out in cold sweat.  \n\nEven the Bandaged Supernatural Entity couldn’t stay silent. \"You’re playing with fire.\"  \n\nJi Yan replied, \"I have my own way of driving it out.\"  \n\n\"As long as the Mission timer’s still running, I can do what I want. If I fail, I’ll take whatever Punishment comes.\"  \n\nThe Bandaged Supernatural Entity didn’t stop him—Ji Yan was right.  \n\nBut it still sneered. \"Damaging the apartment, provoking the Supernatural tenants, harming the Landlord’s interests...\"  \n\n\"When the Mission ends, I can’t even imagine how severe your Punishment will be.\"  \n\n\"That’s a problem for later. Right now, don’t interrupt my work.\"  \n\nJi Yan’s retort made the Bandaged Supernatural Entity’s eyes burn with cold fury.  \n\nCRASH!\n\nAnother chunk of the wall collapsed—not with dust, but with thick, dripping blood.  \n\nIt was open.  \n\nJi Yan’s eyes gleamed.  \n\nNo joy. No fear. Only tension.\n\nThe hole in the wall expanded, and the Kanjing Gui's massive body, no longer constrained, easily slipped into the apartment building. Dirty water gushed out, flooding the first-floor corridor.  \n\nThe stench quickly permeated every resident's room on the first floor.  \n\n\"It really got in...\"  \n\nJi Yan followed behind, stepping over the broken wall, only to hear the overwhelming curses of countless supernatural entity residents echoing from all directions.  \n\n\"Get out!!\"  \n\n\"Who the hell brought this filthy thing into the apartment?\"  \n\n\"Disgusting! Whose brat is this? Not only did they wreck the apartment wall, but they also brought in outside rats!\"  \n\n\"It's that brat from 404, the dead drunkard's kid. Like father, like son!\"  \n\n[Ding! Player, for aiding in the illegal intrusion of a resident into the apartment, 25 supernatural entity residents now hold malice toward you. Among them, 7 have reached a Malice Value of 75%. After the mission concludes, they will seek revenge.]\n\n\"The mess just keeps getting bigger!\"  \n\n\"Is there even any way to clean this up?\"  \n\nListening to the \"greetings\" pouring in from all sides of the corridor, Ji Yan couldn't help but take a deep breath, sweat dripping down his back.  \n\nSixth floor.\n\nThe landlord, puffing on his old pipe, knew what was happening on the first floor but made no move to stop it.  \n\nMuttering to himself, he said, \"This kid... is he trying to survive by courting death? Bold, very bold.\"  \n\nFirst floor, Room 102.\n\nThe door swung open, and Cheng Fang tossed out two dead rats, his face twisted in disgust. \"Did this instance get infected with the Rat Plague today?\"  \n\nLooking up, he saw the gaping hole in the corridor wall and the Kanjing Gui—its bloated, grotesque body dragging across the floor, leaving trails of filthy water.  \n\nHe let out a curse, about to retreat into his room, when he spotted a familiar face. \"Aren’t you... Ji Yan?\"  \n\n\"What the hell are you doing? Repairing the wall or expelling the Rat Plague?\"  \n\nJi Yan glanced at Cheng Fang and shook his head. \"Neither.\"  \n\n\"I helped break the wall, and I let the supernatural entity in.\"  \n\n\"...\"  \n\nCheng Fang's lips twitched. His first thought was: How the hell did he manage to cause such a disaster?\n\n\"Look, if you don’t want to survive in this instance, don’t drag us first-floor players down with you! Today was supposed to be an easy day, but thanks to these damn rats, we’re barely alive!\"  \n\nJi Yan put away his hammer, wiping the grime from his face. \"I’m doing this because I want to live.\"\n\n\"You won’t live for even a second, man.\"  \n\n\"Every resident on the first floor wants to tear you apart now. Even the Charming Specter in my room—whatever goodwill she had for you is gone.\"  \n\n\"Those rats got in and chewed up her 'toys.' Now she’s screaming about draining you dry!\"  \n\nJi Yan didn’t react.  \n\nCheng Fang wanted to say more but suddenly clamped his mouth shut, turned, and bolted back into his room, locking the door behind him.  \n\nA wave of foul stench hit.  \n\nJi Yan turned to see the Kanjing Gui’s grotesquely swollen face looming close. It stared at him. \"Why did you help me?\"  \n\nJi Yan: \"Helping others doesn’t need a reason.\"  \n\nThe Kanjing Gui didn’t question the flimsy excuse. It turned its head, scanning the corridor. \"I’ve lost all memory of this apartment.\"  \n\n\"Can you help me find my old room?\"\n\n\"I know the landlord will come down soon to chase me away. As long as I do what I want to do, I'll leave on my own.\"  \n\nSure enough.  \n\nThis method works!  \n\nBy helping the Resentful Supernatural Entity fulfill its wish, there’s no need for violent expulsion—it will leave voluntarily, and the Rat Plague will naturally disperse.  \n\n\"I'll guide you!\" Ji Yan turned and led the Kanjing Gui forward.  \n\nJust as they rounded the corner, he spotted a familiar figure—Long Yuan, who had just returned to the apartment.  \n\nTheir eyes met.  \n\nLong Yuan’s expression froze.  \n\n\"You… Why are you inside the apartment?!\"  \n\nJi Yan remained silent, but the Kanjing Gui following behind him provided the answer.  \n\nLong Yuan immediately understood. \"You actually brought this damned thing into the apartment?!\"  \n\n\"You’ve got a death wish. Not even the gods can save you now!\"  \n\nJi Yan coldly replied, \"If gods won’t save me, I’ll save myself.\"  \n\n\"Move aside.\"",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 22: A Blood-Stained Wall, The Backstory  \n\nLong Yuan narrowed his eyes, unwilling to get involved, and turned to walk upstairs.  \n\nStanding before the door of Room 102, Ji Yan reached out and knocked.  \n\nNo one answered.  \n\nSeeing the dust on the doorknob, Ji Yan realized the room was unoccupied.  \n\nThe Kanjing Gui behind him stepped forward, grasped the handle, and pushed the door open without hesitation.  \n\nCreak.\n\nThe interior of the room, however, surprised Ji Yan.  \n\nEvery inch was spotless—even a vase or a key tray. The floor gleamed as if freshly polished, clearly indicating someone lived there. Yet, the outside was covered in dust.  \n\nThe Kanjing Gui, barging in, left dirty water splashing everywhere with each step. Strangely, the mutated rats didn’t follow, instead gathering at the doorway.  \n\nReturning to its former home, the Kanjing Gui grew visibly excited, carefully examining and touching everything in the room.  \n\n\"Nothing has changed... This is my home... But where is it?\"  \n\nJi Yan stood behind, glancing at the clock on the wall.  \n\nLess than an hour remained before the mission ended!  \n\nIf the Kanjing Gui didn’t leave the apartment with the Rat Plague within this hour, the enraged supernatural tenants would tear it apart—no need for mission punishment.  \n\n\"Ah—!\"  \n\n\"I just finished cleaning, and now it’s ruined! How did you even get in?\"  \n\nA girl walked in from the balcony.  \n\nSeeing her immaculately cleaned room now reeking and splattered with filth in an instant, she felt as if the sky had collapsed.  \n\nThe drink in her hand fell to the floor.  \n\nJi Yan recognized her as a player.  \n\nDressed sharply, with glossy hair and a plump face, she carried a plate of fresh meat in one hand. Even the spilled drink was freshly squeezed juice.  \n\nSuch abundant living conditions stunned even Ji Yan.  \n\nHe had thought his own survival situation was relatively privileged compared to other players.  \n\nBut this Dyed-Hair Girl—this was living!\n\nThe girl stared at the Kanjing Gui, dripping with grime and garbage as it wandered through her home, clutching her pale face.  \n\n\"What the hell is this thing?!\"  \n\n\"How did it get in? Stop! Don’t touch anything!\"  \n\n\"Damn it, damn it! Everything’s ruined. I’m dead...\"  \n\nAfter finally matching into such a comfortable instance environment, the thought of being eliminated and sent to an even more horrifying one pushed her to the brink of mental collapse.  \n\nJi Yan looked at her. \"Are you the permanent player of Room 102?\"  \n\nThe female player didn’t answer, glaring at Ji Yan with hatred. \"What did I ever do to you?\"  \n\nJi Yan understood her meaning and pointed at the Kanjing Gui. \"Completing the mission. No choice.\"  \n\n\"Besides, that supernatural entity seems to be the original owner of this Room 102.\"  \n\n\"Bullshit! I live here—you think I don’t know who owns 102?\"  \n\n\"You %$#@&...\"\n\nJi Yan had no patience for the Dyed-Hair Girl’s screeching. He reached out, touching every noticeable object in the room.  \n\nIt was like stepping into an information vault—streams of hidden details surfaced, all absorbed by Ji Yan.  \n\nAs he rapidly processed the hidden information, his expression shifted repeatedly.  \n\nIn just two minutes, he finally unraveled the backstory between the Kanjing Gui and Room 102.  \n\nSo that’s how it was!\n\nHe raised his hand to stop the Dyed-Hair Girl's torrent of curses and countered, \"How many days have you survived here?\"  \n\nThe Dyed-Hair Girl glared at Ji Yan in silence.  \n\n\"If you want to keep surviving in this Instance, answer my question.\"  \n\nJi Yan's expression was serious.  \n\nThe Dyed-Hair Girl opened her mouth, then finally spoke as a last resort: \"A month.\"  \n\n\"Was there an Invisible Supernatural Entity assigning you Daily Tasks? Where is it?\"  \n\n\"How did you know?\"  \n\nThe Dyed-Hair Girl's eyes widened.  \n\nA month ago, she had been transported from Blue Star to this Instance, feeling as if the sky had collapsed.  \n\nBut gradually, she realized her survival environment was remarkably safe and comfortable.  \n\nUnlike other Players, who had to venture out daily to face perilous Missions, she only needed to stay inside her room. Her Daily Task was simply to clean thoroughly—every speck of dust in every corner.  \n\nIf she did it well, she would receive three high-quality meals a day, even daily necessities.  \n\nAnd so, the Dyed-Hair Girl survived for a month.  \n\nCompared to other Players struggling in desperate situations, she only had to stay in Room 102, play the role of a housekeeper, and enjoy her freedom the rest of the time.  \n\nBut today, her peaceful life was shattered by the sudden intrusion of one man and one supernatural entity.  \n\n\"Where is it? Take me there.\"  \n\nThe Dyed-Hair Girl turned and led him into a bedroom, pointing at a Bleeding Wall in the depths.  \n\n\"My Daily Tasks are assigned from this wall!\"  \n\n\"The task states that as long as I clean the room satisfactorily every day, I won’t be evicted.\"  \n\nJi Yan stared at the Bleeding Wall.  \n\nAt that moment, the Kanjing Gui, which had been wandering around Room 102, also entered the bedroom. Seeing the wall, it trembled with emotion, its voice shaking: \"I remember now… I remember everything!\"  \n\nJi Yan said to the Dyed-Hair Girl, \"Leave. Don’t interfere with their reunion.\"  \n\nThe Dyed-Hair Girl froze. \"Reunion?\"  \n\n\"Once they’re done, you’ll be safe, and my Mission will be complete.\"  \n\nJi Yan glanced at the continuously bleeding wall, then left the room and closed the door behind him.  \n\nOnce outside, the Dyed-Hair Girl was still dazed, her head full of questions. Before she could speak, Ji Yan cleared his dry throat and asked first, \"Got anything to drink?\"  \n\n\"I’m only responsible for cleaning in this house. I don’t have the right to use anything here.\" She pouted.  \n\nJi Yan looked at her, then at the drink in her hand.  \n\nHesitating, the Dyed-Hair Girl reluctantly handed it over. \"Don’t drink it all at once! I saved up for three days to get this juice!\"  \n\nJi Yan, however, unceremoniously took a big gulp.  \n\nThe Dyed-Hair Girl gritted her teeth. \"Care to explain now?\"  \n\nWiping his mouth, Ji Yan said, \"Let me tell you a story. Once, a father and daughter lived in an apartment. Later, the father couldn’t pay the Rent and was about to be evicted by the Landlord. But the environment outside the apartment was extremely dangerous—being driven out meant certain death.\"  \n\n\"The father came up with a way to let his daughter stay in the apartment forever. Can you guess what it was?\"  \n\nThe Dyed-Hair Girl froze, then thought of the Bleeding Wall. A chill ran down her spine.  \n\n\"The father… sealed his daughter inside the wall?\"\n\n\"That's right. The Father exploited a loophole in the Apartment Rules—none of the walls in the apartment can be altered. He merged the body with the structure, leaving the Landlord powerless. Worse, Room 102 became a 'Haunted House,' making it impossible to rent out.\"  \n\n\"The Daughter remained in the wall, unable to move but at least still 'alive.' After being driven out of the apartment, the Father was corrupted by the harsh environment outside, turning into something neither human nor ghost. He lost most of his memories.\"  \n\n\"But one fragment remained—he remembered that his home was in Room 102 of the apartment, and that someone extremely important to him lived there.\"  \n\n\"He forgot who that person was, but clinging to that obsession, he survived like a walking corpse, becoming a Resentful Supernatural Entity, wandering aimlessly through the dangerous world.\"  \n\n\"One day, he returned to this apartment. Fragments of familiar memories resurfaced, and he went mad trying to find a way back inside...\"  \n\nJi Yan let out a soft sigh.  \n\nLooking at the stunned Dyed-Hair Girl, he said, \"That's the backstory of your Room 102.\"",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 23: Cleaning Up the Mess, Nighttime Task  \n\n\"Uh... this is kinda messed up.\"  \n\nAfter listening to the backstory, the Dyed-Hair Girl fell silent for a long moment before finally summing it up with one sentence.  \n\n\"Whether it's messed up or not doesn’t matter. What’s important is completing the mission.\"  \n\nJi Yan kept an eye on the time while listening to the commotion inside the room, growing increasingly anxious.  \n\nFortunately, after about ten minutes of interaction, the door slowly creaked open.  \n\nThe Kanjing Gui stepped out, its face obscured by thick, sticky black hair like a drowned ghost’s gaze, sending chills down anyone’s spine.  \n\nThe Dyed-Hair Girl hid fearfully behind Ji Yan.  \n\n\"Thank you. Seeing my daughter settled safely here has fulfilled my last wish.\"  \n\n\"It’s time for me to leave. I’ve caused you so much trouble.\"  \n\nThe Kanjing Gui spoke slowly to Ji Yan, the tormenting obsession in its heart finally breaking like chains.  \n\nJi Yan sighed in relief internally, but then his thoughts turned to the massive hole in the wall, stirring fresh worry.  \n\nHow was this gaping hole going to be fixed?  \n\nWho would fill it?  \n\nThe Kanjing Gui raised a hand, reached into its mouth, and pulled a key from its throat, handing it to Ji Yan. \"If you ever run into trouble, use this key to open Room 801’s door.\"  \n\n\"That guy has a bad temper, but... maybe, just maybe, he’ll help you out of a bind for my sake.\"  \n\nThe Kanjing Gui’s tone sounded utterly uncertain.  \n\nBut it knew Ji Yan had risked angering the entire apartment’s residents by breaking through the wall to let it in, stirring up no small mess. This debt had to be repaid somehow.  \n\nThis was all it could think of.  \n\nJi Yan’s lips twitched as he forced a bitter smile. \"Bro, don’t give me ‘maybe’s.\"  \n\n\"The residents on the eighth floor are all ruthless characters.\"  \n\n\"If your face doesn’t count for anything, this isn’t repayment—it’s pure revenge.\"  \n\nThe Kanjing Gui rasped, \"I know how hard it is to survive in this apartment. I’ve done all I can.\"  \n\n\"If you’re in trouble, you can also come to this room. My daughter will help you.\"  \n\nAfter saying this, the Kanjing Gui walked out of the room, the rats gathered at the doorway quickly scattering in its wake.  \n\nJi Yan clutched the key in his hand.  \n\nA game notification chimed in his mind:  \n\n\"Congratulations, Player, for obtaining an additional mission reward—Room 801 Key.\"  \n\n\"Hint: The eighth-floor residents of the apartment are tied to complex backstories and eccentric personalities. Do you think the key in your hand is a blessing... or a curse?\"  \n\nEven the game hints couldn’t be sure?  \n\nHolding the key, Ji Yan felt it burn in his palm.  \n\nLiu Yitong had mentioned before that, according to the Announcement, there were only four residents on the eighth floor. As the highest level of the apartment building, their Rent was double that of other tenants, and many rules didn’t apply to that floor. Each resident had multiple backstories, and the missions triggered there were at least A+ rank.  \n\nEach one was practically a mini-boss from an Instance!  \n\nJi Yan fiddled with the key repeatedly, hoping to trigger his Talent, but no Hidden Information appeared. He had no choice but to give up.  \n\n\"What are you spacing out for? Get out already.\"  \n\n\"It’s almost dark. I need to hurry up and clean the room.\" The Dyed-Hair Girl rolled up her sleeves and spoke to Ji Yan.  \n\nSnapping out of it, Ji Yan apologized for the disturbance and quickly left the room.\n\n\"What the hell, in the end I got nothing and still have to clean up this mess,\" the Dyed-Hair Girl grumbled, clearly displeased.  \n\nBut at least she hadn’t been expelled and could continue slacking off in Room 102 to survive.  \n\nThen, she received a summons from the Bleeding Wall and hurried into the room.  \n\nThe wall oozed even more blood, its mottled surface writhing with crimson streaks that eventually coalesced into two words: \"Thank you.\"  \n\n...  \n\nMeanwhile, when Ji Yan returned to the corridor, the Kanjing Gui had already left, taking the invading rats with it.  \n\nBut the first floor was now a complete disaster after all the chaos.  \n\nFilthy water and trash littered every corner, the stench overwhelming.  \n\n\"It got what it wanted and just left, but what about me?\"  \n\nFaced with such a colossal mess, Ji Yan scratched his head in frustration.  \n\nNo sooner had he spoken than a chill crept up his spine.  \n\nHis heart skipped a beat as he turned to find the Landlord already standing behind him.  \n\nAs the boss of this Instance, despite the old man’s amiable appearance, there was an indescribable pressure about him—like an abyss, terrifying precisely because its depths couldn’t be seen.  \n\n\"Good news and bad news. Which do you want first?\" The Landlord squinted, his smile sending shivers down Ji Yan’s spine.  \n\nJi Yan hesitated. \"Good news?\"  \n\n\"The good news is, those pesky rats are gone. Consider your Mission complete.\"  \n\nJi Yan showed no joy. \"And the bad news?\"  \n\n\"The bad news is, you chose the worst possible way to complete it.\"  \n\n\"The rewards from the Mission won’t make up for the hole in the wall or this mess on the first floor.\"  \n\nJi Yan didn’t pale at the words. Instead, he countered, \"So, how am I supposed to compensate for it?\"  \n\nThe Landlord chuckled. \"A brat like you, barely scraping by in Room 404, can’t even pay Rent—what could you possibly offer?\"  \n\nJi Yan shook his head. \"If I couldn’t fix this, you wouldn’t be wasting your breath on me.\"  \n\n\"Those first-floor tenants who hate my guts would’ve already torn me apart by now.\"  \n\n\"You stopped them.\"  \n\nThe Landlord tapped his old pipe, looking mildly surprised. \"Hah, not bad, kid. Sharp mind.\"  \n\n\"I’ll give you a nighttime Mission. Complete it, and I’ll overlook the hole in the wall.\"  \n\nA nighttime Mission.  \n\nThe fatality rate was twice as high as during the day!  \n\nJi Yan scrambled for an excuse. \"But doesn’t the apartment enforce a curfew at night? Why not switch it to daytime?\"  \n\n\"This Mission can’t be done during the day.\"  \n\n\"You’ve got a Night Patrol Permit, boy. Don’t try to fool this old man.\"  \n\n\"You’ve got two choices. The other one is me handing you over to the tenants.\"  \n\n\"What do you say, kid?\"  \n\nFaced with the Landlord’s kindly expression, Ji Yan forced a smile that looked more like a grimace. \"Do I really have a choice, old man?\"  \n\nThe Landlord patted Ji Yan’s shoulder. \"Kid, I have high hopes for you.\"  \n\n\"We’re all tenants here. Shouldn’t we all do our part to maintain a good environment?\"  \n\n\"Don’t think of it as a loss. Do the Mission well, and I’ll personally reward you.\"\n\nThe more amiable the Landlord appeared, the more uneasy Ji Yan felt. He decided to cut to the chase: \"Old man, no beating around the bush—how many people have taken on this late-night job?\"  \n\n\"So far, about eleven.\"  \n\n\"Any survivors?\"  \n\n\"Young man, the way you phrase that...\"  \n\nThe Landlord shook his head with a chuckle before continuing, \"Not many.\"  \n\n\"...\"  \n\nJi Yan was utterly exhausted, both physically and mentally.  \n\nThese life-threatening missions just kept coming one after another!  \n\nWas the heavens testing his resilience, or was someone pulling strings behind the scenes?  \n\nIf he remembered correctly, his initial mission today was simply to deliver a sachet—a straightforward task that would’ve allowed him to wrap up smoothly and lazily survive another day.  \n\nBut just because he took an extra glance at the announcement in the hallway, things had spiraled into this dire situation!  \n\nIt truly fit the saying: Don’t pluck the tempting flowers by the roadside.\n\n\"Count yourself lucky. Compared to the other unlucky ones, you’re at least still alive.\"  \n\nJi Yan knew the Landlord was referring to the other players who had taken on the mission. He couldn’t help but ask, \"What happened to them?\"  \n\n\"Mission failed. They were all used to fill the walls.\"  \n\n\"...\"",

    "translatedContent": "Chapter 24: Seizing Weaknesses, Grandmother's Gift  \n\n\"What exactly is the mission?\" Ji Yan asked quietly.  \n\n\"You'll find out at midnight tonight. Go back and rest early.\"  \n\n\"As for this mess, I'll handle it for you. Normally, I wouldn’t bother chatting this much with you.\"  \n\n\"Whoever makes the mess should be the one to clean it up.\"  \n\n\"But since you’ve got a sharp mind and quick hands, I’m giving you this opportunity.\" The Landlord stroked his beard and spoke slowly.  \n\n\"That Long Yuan guy seems pretty capable. Why not ask him?\" Ji Yan deliberately brought up Long Yuan.  \n\n\"You can’t compare to him. That kid hasn’t made any mistakes, and he hasn’t missed any rent.\"  \n\nJi Yan understood: \"Got it. He’s got no weaknesses to exploit.\"  \n\n\"I messed up, and you caught me red-handed.\"  \n\nLandlord: \"Smart.\"  \n\n\"...\"  \n\n\"Alright, go back now. Don’t linger here.\"  \n\nThe Landlord picked up his pipe and stepped aside.  \n\nJi Yan didn’t press further. Chatting too much with an Instance boss like this might trigger another deadly mission.  \n\nAs Ji Yan headed upstairs, the Landlord shook the ash from his pipe and called out toward the corridor: \"Come out and get to work. Hurry up—it’s almost dark.\"  \n\nIn the corridor, as his voice echoed, the walls on either side began to squirm slightly, revealing pairs of pale, ghastly eyeballs...  \n\n...  \n\nMeanwhile, Ji Yan confirmed the completion of the Announcement Task as he climbed the stairs. The game’s notification chimed.  \n\nDing! Congratulations, Player! You have completed the Announcement Task: \"Resolving the Drainage Ditch Rat Plague to Create a Better Living Environment for the Apartment.\" All residents’ favorability toward you has increased by 5%!\n\nDing! Due to incorrect mission completion methods, first-floor residents collectively harbor 15% Malice Value toward you.\n\nAnnouncement Task Rewards: Your residence, Room 404, will enjoy a Rent Reduction for the next seven days. You have obtained a Collector's Grade Purple Treasure Chest!\n\nCongratulations! You have collected one [Talent Fragment]. Current progress for Talent upgrade: 1/3. Keep up the good work and continue collecting!\n\nTwo more fragments?  \n\nJi Yan frowned. He felt tricked—this wasn’t made clear at all earlier, misleading him into thinking one fragment would be enough for an upgrade.  \n\nDid the system learn this \"one more cut\" scam from Pinduoduo?  \n\nIf he collects all three, will there suddenly be another progress bar?  \n\nShaking his head, he glanced at the fluctuating favorability values and felt even more exasperated.  \n\nSo after working like a volunteer for the apartment, not a single \"thank you,\" and now he’s made enemies with several residents?  \n\nJi Yan couldn’t figure out—if his method of completing the mission was wrong, what was the right way?\n\nIf he hadn’t let the Kanjing Gui in, its unresolved grudge would’ve kept it lingering. Forcibly driving it away wasn’t an option either...  \n\nBut seeing the mission rewards, Ji Yan managed to console himself a little.  \n\nHe wasn’t in a hurry to open the treasure chest. Instead, he returned to Room 404 first to report the task to the Grandmother.  \n\nAs soon as he stepped inside, he received another prompt.  \n\nCongratulations, Player! Because you secured a seven-day Rent Reduction for Room 404, both [Mother] and [Grandmother] now see you as a responsible and mature child. Their favorability toward you has increased by 20%!\n\nJi Yan’s eyes gleamed.  \n\nIn the living room, Liu Yitong had returned early and was sitting at the dining table, eating dinner.\n\nSeeing Ji Yan covered in filth, he was almost unrecognizable—at first glance, one might mistake him for a rogue Supernatural Entity barging in. Upon closer inspection, however, the observer couldn’t help but gape in shock.  \n\n“You… weren’t you just delivering a sachet?”  \n\n“How did you end up like this?”  \n\n“It’s a long story. Just pretend I fell into a ditch,” Ji Yan replied helplessly.  \n\n“By the way, the first floor seems pretty lively. I heard some idiot actually broke through the apartment wall and flooded the hallway with dirty water. The Supernatural Entities living there are furious.”  \n\n“I bet that unlucky fool died horribly!”  \n\n“How could someone possibly cause such a mess?”  \n\n“……”  \n\nToo exhausted to explain, Ji Yan stripped off his shirt and headed for the bathroom.  \n\nAfter washing off the grime, he knocked on the Grandmother’s door and entered.  \n\n“Grandmother, I delivered the sachet. The Landlord accepted it.”  \n\nOn the bed, the Grandmother sat with her reading glasses on, knitting a sweater, her expression kind and gentle.  \n\n“Good, you delivered it.”  \n\n“But now you’ve landed yourself in a heap of trouble.”  \n\nWithout looking up, she already knew Ji Yan’s predicament.  \n\nJust crawled out of the pit of an Announcement Task, only to tumble into another one dug by the Landlord.  \n\nJi Yan forced a stiff smile. “Doing some volunteer work for the apartment is only right. It’s no trouble.”  \n\nThe Grandmother chuckled softly. “You’re like a duck.”  \n\nJi Yan: “Huh?”  \n\n“Even when boiled alive, your beak stays hard.”  \n\n“……”  \n\nSetting the sweater aside, the Grandmother finally looked at him. “That old Landlord is shrewd—he never makes a bad deal.”  \n\n“This apartment building may seem sturdy, standing unshaken in this world, but it’s actually riddled with holes.”  \n\n“And he’ll always find a way to make you outsiders patch them up.”  \n\n“He ‘helped’ you clean up the mess on the first floor, making you think you got a good deal. But in truth, he dumped an even worse mess on you.”  \n\n“You shouldn’t have read that Announcement.”  \n\nJi Yan stayed silent.  \n\nThere was no point in arguing now.  \n\n“What kind of job did that old man dump on you?”  \n\n“Not sure yet. Only know it’s after midnight.”  \n\nHearing “after midnight,” the Grandmother shook her head. “A rotten task.”  \n\nClearly, she knew more but wasn’t saying. Ji Yan wisely didn’t press.  \n\n“Alright, this one’s knitted by me personally. How does it look?”  \n\nShe handed him a sweater—a dark red, high-necked cardigan that didn’t look tacky at all.  \n\nAs Ji Yan took it, a hidden information panel popped up:  \n\n“Congratulations, Player! You’ve obtained the Supernatural Artifact—[White Silk Ghost’s Sweater]. It can block three fatal supernatural attacks and increase your Mental Resilience by 25%.”\n\n(Higher Mental Resilience strengthens immunity to supernatural assimilation.)\n\n“Hidden Information: When the sweater is 95% damaged, it will trigger a Backlash Effect, causing a burning reaction.”\n\n“Backlash Effect?” Ji Yan’s brow twitched.  \n\nThe Grandmother continued, “I added a little ‘extra’ to this sweater.”  \n\n“If you’re in danger at night, it’ll protect you—but only for a limited time. Use that time to save yourself.”  \n\nHer words indirectly confirmed that tonight’s Mission would be far from safe.  \n\nThe Grandmother had deliberately left him with a riddle.\n\nBut she didn’t know that her little riddle had already been completely deciphered by the Talent 【Omniscient Understanding】.  \n\n\"I understand.\"  \n\n\"Then I’ll take my leave now.\"  \n\nJi Yan accepted the Grandmother’s additional rewards and prepared to exit the room.  \n\nPerhaps due to the steadily accumulating favorability, the Grandmother added another reminder: \"If you ever face trouble you can’t shake off, find a way to run back home. Once you’re inside, Grandma can lend a little help.\"  \n\n\"But not much.\"  \n\n\"Thank you, Grandma.\" Ji Yan nodded and left the room.  \n\nDing! The Player has completed today’s Mission assigned by 【Grandmother】. Current accumulated favorability with this Supernatural Entity: 45%.\n\nCongratulations! You have triggered the \"Generational Affection\" effect. The Grandmother Supernatural Entity now feels protective of you. Within the bounds of Room 404, if danger or threats arise, Grandma will provide you with some level of protection.\n\nKeep it up and strive to unlock even closer relationships!\n\nDing! You have received today’s dinner from the Grandmother Supernatural Entity. She personally prepared a nutritious meal for you. The food can be collected in the kitchen.\n\n\"So this is the benefit of high favorability? Damn it, I’ve been surviving in this Instance for days, and only now do I finally get to enjoy it.\"  \n\nJust thinking about it made Ji Yan furious.  \n\nIt was all because of that damned Nightmare Devourer, giving him such a disastrous start.  \n\nEven if that deadbeat drunkard father of his had already turned to ashes and logged off, Ji Yan still wanted to dig him up and give him a good thrashing.",

Lifting the lid, he saw white vapor rising from a bubbling meat soup.  \n\nBlack chunks of meat floated in the greasy broth. The aroma was pleasant, but the appearance was unsettling, making it hard to muster an appetite.  \n\n\"Whatever. As long as it doesn’t kill me.\"  \n\nJi Yan carried the pot out of the kitchen.  \n\nLiu Yitong’s eyes widened slightly at the sight of the steaming soup.  \n\n\"Want some?\" Ji Yan offered.  \n\n\"No... This is your special dinner. It wouldn’t be right for me to have any. It might affect the Grandmother Supernatural Entity’s favorability.\"  \n\n\"But how did you manage this? I’ve completed seven Daily Tasks for the Grandmother Supernatural Entity, and she’s never personally made me a meal.\"  \n\n\"And it’s only your first day interacting with her. This is unbelievable!\"  \n\nJi Yan wasn’t particularly surprised.  \n\nHe had reduced half of Room 404’s Rent for seven days—a dinner as a reward made sense.  \n\nBut thinking about tonight’s unknown night task, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the Grandmother Supernatural Entity was preparing him a farewell meal.  \n\nHe quickly dismissed the thought.  \n\nToo ominous.  \n\nSince Liu Yitong refused, Ji Yan didn’t press further. Starving, he ladled a bowl and dug in.  \n\nHe had no idea what kind of meat the black chunks were.  \n\nSour.  \n\nNot unpalatable, though. It had been stewed so long that it fell apart at the slightest bite.  \n\nDing!\n\n\"Player Alert: After consuming the special nutrient meal, your body has absorbed additional benefits. All stats have been restored to full.\"  \n\n\"Specter Power +1, Specter Power +1...\"  \n\nWatching the green Information Panel pop up, Ji Yan’s expression shifted. He immediately began eating even more voraciously.  \n\nAfter devouring everything, he didn’t leave a single drop of broth behind.  \n\nLiu Yitong sat nearby. \"Looks like you were really starving.\"  \n\nWiping his mouth, Ji Yan felt the surge of energy in his body. \"Nutrient meals are about replenishment. Taste is secondary.\"  \n\nSuddenly, Liu Yitong remembered something. She pulled a flashlight from her pocket and handed it to Ji Yan. \"Here, take this.\"  \n\nJi Yan frowned. \"Why?\"  \n\n\"The Mother Supernatural Entity asked me to give it to you.\"  \n\n\"Don’t ask me—I don’t know either.\"  \n\n\"You haven’t even interacted with her, yet you’re already getting equipment rewards from her. This is the first time I’ve seen something like this.\"  \n\nLiu Yitong couldn’t hide her astonishment.  \n\nAt first, Ji Yan had seemed cursed by bad luck. But ever since the Father Supernatural Entity was taken out, his misfortune had somehow turned into incredible fortune?  \n\n\"She only said one thing: take this tonight. If you’re lost in the abyss and can’t find your way home, turn on the flashlight. The light will guide you back.\"  \n\nThe words confused Liu Yitong.  \n\nBut Ji Yan fell into thought.  \n\nBoth the Mother and Grandmother Supernatural Entities had warned him to be careful tonight. Just how dangerous was this mission going to be?  \n\nTaking the flashlight, an equipment notification popped up—though there was no Hidden Information attached.  \n\n\"Congratulations, Player! You have obtained the equipment: Wandering Ghost Flashlight.\"  \n\nAfter a quick glance, Ji Yan tossed it into his Toolbar.\n\nThinking carefully, the Mother and Grandmother had indeed taken excessively thorough care of him. But then again, considering he had killed the Supernatural Entity Father and reduced the Rent, the double favorability boost made these protective rewards quite reasonable.  \n\nSoon, the sky darkened.  \n\nThe Players who had been bustling around the apartment all returned to their own rooms.  \n\nJi Yan lay on the bed but couldn’t sleep—not because of insomnia, but because he was too energized.  \n\nThanks to that pot of soup, all his stats were now at full capacity. Clearly, the Grandmother had planned this step in advance. If a Player lacked sufficient sleep, their stats would drop significantly, leading to symptoms like confusion, dizziness, and vertigo, severely affecting their in-game performance.  \n\nTaking advantage of the spare time, Ji Yan opened the unclaimed treasure chest in his Toolbar.  \n\nOpening a mystery box was always exhilarating.  \n\nWith a click to claim, the item popped up before his eyes.  \n\n\"Successfully opened a Collector's Grade Purple Treasure Chest. Congratulations, Player, on obtaining the Supernatural Artifact—Blood Coffin Nails ×3.\" (Collector's Grade) (Single-use)\n\n\"Description: Nails capable of sealing a Blood-Clad Vengeful Ghost. Their value speaks for itself—no further explanation needed.\"\n\nThat was it.  \n\nJust three nails?  \n\nJi Yan examined the three rusted, finger-length nails in his palm.  \n\nThough they looked like ordinary rusty nails picked up from the roadside, their Collector's Grade rating meant their lethality was undoubtedly formidable. Still, for such a large treasure chest to yield only three nails felt somewhat underwhelming—falling short of Ji Yan’s expectations.  \n\nOne more Supernatural Artifact meant one more layer of security.  \n\nJi Yan was just an ordinary person, valuing his life and fearing death. Those high-risk, high-reward maneuvers were nothing more than acts of desperation.  \n\nHe continued resting in his room, gradually hearing the movements of the nighttime-spawning NPC Supernatural Entities outside.  \n\nUnsurprisingly, his door was knocked on again, but Ji Yan ignored it.  \n\nOnly when the clock struck midnight did he open his eyes, get out of bed, and retrieve the Night Patrol Permit, fastening it to his chest.  \n\n\"Ding! Supernatural Artifact Activation. You have gained the privilege to go out at night. Before 3:00 AM, you will be immune to all hostility from nighttime Supernatural Entities.\"\n\n(Hint: Immunity only—do not provoke them actively.)\n\nThe knocking on the door persisted. Ji Yan opened it.  \n\nOutside crouched a Supernatural Entity with no lower body, dragging its bloodied waist, its half-rotted face lifting as if ready to attack.  \n\nBut in the next second, it seemed to lose its target, its expression turning dull and vacant.  \n\nThen, it silently turned and went to knock on Liu Yitong’s door next door.  \n\nJi Yan blinked, then turned and walked toward the living room.  \n\nThe late-night living room was, as usual, bustling with activity.  \n\nTerrifying, indistinct shadows of Supernatural Entities—like homeless, aimless wandering spirits—drifted through every corner of Room 404.  \n\nJi Yan, a living human walking among them, felt every hair on his body stand on end.  \n\nBut thanks to the badge on his chest, these nighttime Supernatural Entities passed by him as if he were invisible.  \n\n\"It’s midnight—why hasn’t the Old Man arrived yet?\"\n\nJust as the thought crossed his mind, the door was knocked again.  \n\nIn the next instant, the nighttime Supernatural Entities in the living room scattered like startled Rats, fleeing in panic.  \n\n\"What could scare them like that?\"\n\nThough Ji Yan muttered the question, he already had a good guess who was outside.\n\nSure enough, when the door opened, the old man in a white Tang suit stood in the corridor, holding an old tobacco pipe in one hand and a birdcage in the other.  \n\nThe parrot inside stared straight at Ji Yan.  \n\n\"Taking the bird for a stroll at this hour? Quite the enthusiasm,\" Ji Yan said dismissively.  \n\nInwardly, he scoffed—who the hell takes a bird out for a walk past midnight? That’s just plain insane.  \n\n\"Smart mouth.\"  \n\nWith that, the Landlord handed him an old-fashioned key.  \n\n\"Get to work.\"  \n\n\"This is the key to the rooftop door.\"  \n\nJi Yan took the key, baffled. \"What am I supposed to do?\"  \n\n\"The apartment’s rooftop water tank has been acting up. Lately, tenants have been complaining about dirty tap water. Go clean it.\"  \n\nAs he spoke, the wrinkles on the Landlord’s face smoothed into a disturbingly eerie smile.  \n\n\"Just some filth in the water tank. Clean it up, and it’ll be fine.\"  \n\n\"The mission is simple.\"  \n\nThe Landlord patted Ji Yan’s shoulder.  \n\nNo matter how hard Ji Yan tried to believe his words, everything—from that smile to the carefully chosen phrasing—screamed at him.  \n\nThis job wasn’t simple. It was downright deadly!",
