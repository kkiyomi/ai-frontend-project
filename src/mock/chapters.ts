修行者陣營

羅峰他們八位領主迅速逼近始祖一方。

“距離夠了！”元眼神熾熱，“按照原計劃，施展'咒殺劫陣'！”

在較遠距離，并且始祖一方有著重重陣法防御的情況下，羅峰他們唯一能夠無視一切防御陣法的招數就是'咒殺劫陣'，這咒殺劫陣，可無視一切物質阻礙、能量阻礙，直抵目標所在。咒殺劫陣，是羅峰的刀法'斷生機'，摩曼領主燃燒主戰分身的'波動殺'，金領主的'劫滅'，星芒領主的'時空噬滅'。

他們四位領主的招數在元的陣法統領下，完美配合，聯合殺敵。像羅峰，金，星芒施展的招數，都有種種限制，即便羅峰掌握兩條道后，配合血影刀施展的斷生機，威力也依舊有限。

唯有摩曼領主，他的渾源波動道本就特殊，他的尋常招數敵人都是難以抵擋的。一般都是得硬抗。

所以，他完全可以徹底燃燒主戰分身，施展滅絕生命波動的殺招。

他們四位，摩曼領主的威勢占據五成，羅峰占據三成，星芒占據一成五，金占據半成。最后他們又有元統領，令配合后整體威力提升三倍多。

嗡…………

咒劫殺陣在元的引領下，一旦發動，宛如無盡渾源空間規則之運轉，降下劫難。這一招，不可窺探，難以感知。

八位領主遙看遠處，都期待著這一殺陣的結果。

始祖一方嚴陣以待，重眾陣法防御戒備。當咒劫殺陣降臨之時，絕大部分始祖們都沒有任何感知。

“不好！”

時空之母，末古斯，寂滅始祖，沙舟等不超過十位始祖生出感應。雖然生出感應，可它們只能判斷無形危機針對的是不是它們。

至于針對目標，它們也難以感知

夢魘始祖有著一顆無比巨大的眼睛。這眼睛占據身軀的大半。

它非常擅長營造夢境。

這也是它唯一擅長的。

但它不擅長近身搏殺。

肉身也很一般。所以躲在重重陣法深處。

“嗡……”

劫難降臨，落在夢魘始祖身上。

這劫難，有從過去未來襲來的重重力量降臨，仿佛要將它從時間上抹殺。夢魘始祖那巨大的眼珠軀體一顫，便已經身死。

身死之時，巨大眼珠都有著不甘、后悔。

八位領主，遠距離無視一切防御的殺招————咒劫殺陣，在七位擅長靈魂招數的始祖當中選定身軀最弱的一個夢魘始祖，一招便見效。其實這七位擅長靈魂道路的招數，除了九皇之一的寂滅始祖外，其他六個肉身都弱。

不死不滅的末古斯，身軀都是靈魂力量組成，同樣脆弱。

嘩……在夢魘始祖身死的剎那，瞬間有力量將它的尸體帶到了其他時間線，直接憑空消失。

“什么？”

“夢魘死了？”“在整個大陣的重重庇護下，怎么會死了？”

始祖一方驚怒萬分。

雖然八位領主的咒殺劫陣是一剎那的事情，可始祖們對周圍感知無比敏銳，清晰感知到'夢魘始祖'生機斷絕以及被帶走尸體的過程。“能無視一切阻礙的招數，威力一般都很弱，八位領主當中，摩曼領主雖然擅長這類招數，可即便是燃燒主戰分身，它也最多傷到始祖罷了。怎么可能瞬間滅殺一位始祖？”

在場個個都不敢相信。天生渾源陣營和修行者陣營斗了很久，過去戰爭的時候，它們早就熟悉了摩曼領主的種種詭異手段。

很多招數都是悄無聲息滲透，是傷勢逐漸累計的。

即便羅峰突破后，摩曼能夠燃燒主戰分身，可也沒法做到滅殺一位始祖。這次是羅峰的斷生機刀法夠強，能配合摩曼。

而且元也突破了。

突破后的渾源規則運轉之道，使得領主配合威力更強一籌。方才能夠滅掉肉身弱的一位始祖。

可這一幕場景，足以讓眾多始祖們驚怒……

“拉近距離！”始祖一方驚怒的同時，也是立即朝八位領主靠近過去。

它們集體穿梭時空，迅速逼近。

咒劫殺陣這一招雖然能算遠距離殺招。可在時空穿梭面前，僅僅一息時間，雙方就已經見到了彼此。

完全燃燒掉主戰分身的摩曼領主，在羅峰的幫助下，已經完全恢復了。

“對付羅峰！”蘑菇石看了眼此刻穿著花花綠綠，露出一雙大腳的元，顧不得多想，當即傳音給麾下五位同伴。

失去了夢魘始祖，它們配合的威力有所下降。

可終究是末古斯為首，其他五位始祖為輔，靈魂招數依舊有之前的八九成威力。嗡……

靈魂招數，同樣不可窺探，無法感知，瞬間中招。

“羅峰能撐住嗎？”

元，星芒，摩曼他們都有些擔憂。他們是很忌憚那靈魂招數的，所以才遠距離施展咒殺劫陣先滅掉一個夢魘始祖，盡量削弱靈魂招數威力。

“夢魘始祖畢竟只是個配合的，末古斯才是核心，這一靈魂招數威力弱不了太多。”

元眼中也有著擔憂。它親身經歷過那一招，知曉那一招的可怕。

如果他的渾源規則運轉之道，沒有悟出本源體系，他是不敢融合諸多分意識的。

估計也要一直壓制諸多分意識，能發揮三四成實力就不錯了。“羅峰太年輕，比我經歷少多了！”

元擔憂看著羅峰。

忽然，七位領主都有些驚愕！因為在他們擔憂之時，他們八位聯手的戰陣運轉沒有絲毫影響。

他們八位力量完美配合，也抵擋了始祖一方鋪天蓋地的攻擊。

“羅峰的實力……沒任何削弱？”元，摩曼，金他們驚愕萬分。

中了靈魂招數，影響些許時間，才算正常。

完全沒影響？“都看著我干什么？”

羅峰看著七位同伴。

“你沒感覺？

元忍不住問道。”沒感覺！“

羅峰搖頭。

戰陣完美運轉，抵擋住一切來襲威能。

另一邊……末古斯以及五位同伴在施展靈魂招數時……

”這是？“

末古斯作為施展者，能感知到它的力量觸碰到了讓他心悸的一種力量，恍惚間，末古斯仿佛看到了毀滅之淵。毀滅之淵的一部分力量正時刻加持在羅峰身上。

作為最高層次神秘之地，羅峰雖然只是獲得毀滅之淵七份力量中的一份，可這一份力量卻有著無盡神奇。

它超出了物質，能量范疇，還蘊含了毀滅之淵的部分規則。單論力量的特殊，毀滅之淵這一部分力量，從質的角度已經達到無盡渾源空間的理論極限。

一切物質，能量，時間，因果，靈魂……單純任何一脈，都無法凌駕它之上。

它就代表了極致。當然，羅峰也僅僅只能借用一部分。

星芒領主觀看未來無數時間線，都無法窺探到羅峰的未來，便是毀滅世界之力干擾的緣故。

”啊……“靈魂招數和毀滅世界之力接觸的剎那，末古斯恍惚間看到毀滅之淵，甚至有無數殺意、恨意、冤屈，恐懼等濃烈負面情緒沖擊過來。

它的靈魂招數也受到了毀滅世界之力影響。

僅僅只有三四成威能真正作用到羅峰身上。”他有毀滅之淵的庇護。“

末古斯立即明白這一點。

”連靈魂力量，都會遭到毀滅之淵力量的阻礙干擾！“它之前一直很驕傲，一直覺得同為最高層次之力，靈魂力量是超越其他力量的……

可這一次，在毀滅之淵的力量面前，靈魂力量也被阻礙了。

”不愧是最高層次神秘之地的力量！“羅峰能感知到，毀滅世界之力仿佛自己的盔甲，靈魂招數經過削弱后，以自己的心靈意志完全能抗住，根本沒有陷進去。

從頭到尾，自己都是絕對清醒的，也就看一場幻境罷了！

”羅峰老弟厲害，厲害。比我強多了。哈哈哈。我們再來一次咒殺劫陣。“元開心大笑。

”再來！“

摩曼領主興奮，再度徹底燃燒主戰分身。

再一次施展咒殺劫陣。雖然摩曼領主徹底燃燒主戰分身后，令領主們的防御戰陣有所削弱，可僅僅少了摩曼領主，領主們的戰陣論防御能力依舊有九成。

羅峰，元，星芒他們才是戰陣的三大核心。

”不！“始祖陣營當中，千眼始祖驚恐絕望。

在驚恐當中，它的命核已然裂開……

作為七位擅長靈魂招數的始祖當中，肉身第二脆弱的千眼始祖，同樣沒能抗住咒殺劫陣，瞬間斃命。斃命的同時，千眼始祖尸體也消失了……

毫無疑問，是被星芒偷走了。

”完了！“

”糟了！“

”要敗了！“始祖們看到這一幕，都明白了這一點。

八位領主聯手毫無破綻，靈魂招數，元雖然短暫中招，可現在恢復了。

羅峰更是完全沒感覺。至于星芒？

根本無法鎖定星芒！

三個目標都奈何不了。可擅長靈魂招數的始祖，已經死了兩位。

這場戰爭，已經輸了。

真的拼下去，死去的始祖只會越來越多。

The eight lords including Luo Feng rapidly closed in on the progenitor faction.

"The distance is sufficient!" Yuan's eyes burned with intensity. "Execute the 'Curse Killing Cataclysm Formation' as planned!"

At this extended range with the progenitor faction protected by multiple defensive arrays, the only technique that could ignore all defensive formations was the 'Curse Killing Cataclysm Formation'. This formation bypassed all material obstacles and energy barriers, striking directly at the target. The formation combined Luo Feng's blade technique 'Sever Life', Lord Momann's burning main combat clone's 'Wave Kill', Lord Jin's 'Cataclysm', and Lord Xingmang's 'Time-Space Devour'.

Under Yuan's formation coordination, the techniques of these four lords combined perfectly for joint attack. Techniques like those used by Luo Feng, Jin, and Xingmang had various limitations—even after mastering two paths and wielding the Blood Shadow Blade, Luo Feng's Sever Life still had limited power.

Only Lord Momann was different. His Primal Chaos Wave Dao was inherently special, making even his ordinary attacks difficult for enemies to defend against, typically requiring direct resistance.

Thus, he could completely burn his main combat clone to execute this life-extinguishing wave technique killer move.

Among the four contributors, Lord Momann accounted for 50% of the power, Luo Feng 30%, Xingmang 1.5%, and Jin 0.5%. Under Yuan's final coordination, the combined power increased by over three times.

Hummmmm...

Once activated under Yuan's guidance, the Curse Killing Cataclysm Formation operated like the rules of the endless Primal Chaos Space descending with calamitous force. This attack was undetectable and nearly impossible to perceive.

The eight lords watched from afar, all anticipating the results of this killing formation.

The progenitor faction stood ready behind multiple defensive arrays. When the Curse Killing Cataclysm Formation descended, the vast majority of progenitors remained completely unaware.

"Danger!"

Fewer than ten progenitors including Mother of Time and Space, Mogus, Silent Extinction Progenitor, and Shazhou sensed the threat. Though they detected the danger, they could only determine whether the invisible threat targeted themselves.

They couldn't perceive the actual target.

Nightmare Progenitor possessed an enormous eye that occupied most of its body.

It excelled at creating dreamscapes.

This was its only specialty.

It was poor at close combat.

Its physical body was relatively weak, so it hid deep within the multiple defensive arrays.

"Hummm..."

The calamity descended, striking Nightmare Progenitor.

The attack came from forces assaulting through past and future, as if attempting to erase it from the timeline. Nightmare Progenitor's giant eyeball body trembled briefly before perishing.

At the moment of death, the enormous eye showed clear signs of unwillingness and regret.

The eight lords' long-range killing move that ignored all defenses—the Curse Killing Cataclysm Formation—targeted the physically weakest among the seven soul-specialist progenitors, Nightmare Progenitor, and proved instantly effective. In truth, among these seven experts in soul techniques, aside from Silent Extinction Progenitor (one of the Nine Emperors), the other six had weak physical bodies. Mogus, though immortal and indestructible, had a body composed entirely of soul power and was equally fragile.

Whoosh... The moment Nightmare Progenitor died, a force instantly transported its corpse to another timeline, causing it to vanish into thin air.

"What?"

"Nightmare is dead?" "How could it die under the heavy protection of the grand formation?"

The progenitor faction was both shocked and enraged.

Although the eight lords' Curse Killing Cataclysm Formation lasted only an instant, the progenitors' perception was extremely sharp—they clearly sensed Nightmare Progenitor's life force being severed and its corpse being taken away. "Moves that ignore all obstacles usually have weak power. Among the eight lords, Lord Momann may excel in such techniques, but even burning his main combat clone would at most injure a progenitor. How could it instantly kill one?"

None of those present could believe it. The Innate Primal Chaos Faction and the Practitioner Faction had fought for a long time, and during past wars, they had become familiar with Lord Momann's various strange methods. Many of his techniques involved silent infiltration and cumulative damage. Even after Luo Feng's breakthrough, Momann burning his main combat clone shouldn't have been able to kill a progenitor. This time, it was because Luo Feng's Sever Life blade technique was strong enough to complement Momann. Moreover, Yuan had also broken through. His advancement in Primal Chaos Rule Operation Dao enhanced the lords' coordination and power, enabling them to eliminate a progenitor with a weak physical body.

Yet this scene was enough to shock and enrage the numerous progenitors...

"Close the distance!" While shocked and angry, the progenitor faction immediately moved toward the eight lords. They collectively traversed spacetime, rapidly closing in. Although the Curse Killing Cataclysm Formation could be considered a long-range killing move, with spacetime travel, the two sides were face-to-face in mere moments.

Lord Momann, who had completely burned his main combat clone, had fully recovered with Luo Feng's help.

"Target Luo Feng!" Mogus glanced at Yuan, who was now wearing colorful clothing and revealing his large feet, but didn't dwell on it, immediately transmitting orders to his five companions. With Nightmare Progenitor gone, their coordinated power had diminished. Still, led by Mogus and supported by the other five progenitors, their soul techniques retained 80-90% of their previous potency. Hum...

Soul techniques, equally undetectable and imperceptible, struck instantly.

"Can Luo Feng withstand it?"

Yuan, Lord Xingmang, and Momann were all somewhat concerned. They deeply feared those soul techniques, which was why they had used the long-range Curse Killing Cataclysm Formation to first eliminate one Nightmare Progenitor, attempting to weaken the power of the soul techniques as much as possible.

"After all, the Nightmare Progenitor was merely support—Mogus is the true core. The power of this soul technique won't be weakened too significantly."

Yuan's eyes also held worry. It had personally experienced that move and knew its terror.

If it hadn't comprehended the origin system through its Primal Chaos Rule Operation Dao, it wouldn't have dared to fuse the multiple split consciousnesses. It would probably have had to continuously suppress them, barely managing to exert thirty to forty percent of its strength. "Luo Feng is too young, with far less experience than me!"

Yuan watched Luo Feng with concern.

Suddenly, all seven lords were astonished! Because while they were worried, the battle formation operated by the eight of them showed not the slightest disruption.

Their eight powers coordinated perfectly, still blocking the overwhelming attacks from the progenitor side.

"Luo Feng's strength... hasn't diminished at all?" Yuan, Momann, Jin, and the others were stunned.

Being affected by a soul technique and experiencing some temporary impairment would be normal. But completely unaffected? "Why is everyone looking at me?"

Luo Feng glanced at his seven companions.

"You don't feel anything?"

Yuan couldn't help asking. "No sensation at all!"

Luo Feng shook his head.

The battle formation operated flawlessly, resisting all incoming forces.

On the other side... as Mogus and its five companions were executing the soul technique...

"What is this?"

As the practitioner, Mogus could sense its power touching a force that made its heart tremble. In a daze, Mogus seemed to see the Destruction Abyss. A portion of the Destruction Abyss's power was constantly enhancing Luo Feng.

As the highest-level mysterious place, although Luo Feng had only obtained one of the seven parts of the Destruction Abyss's power, this single portion possessed endless marvels.

It transcended the categories of matter and energy, containing part of the rules of the Destruction Abyss. In terms of the uniqueness of power, this portion from the Destruction Abyss had reached the theoretical limit of the endless Primal Chaos Space in quality.

All matter, energy, time, causality, soul... no single path alone could surpass it. It represented the ultimate. Of course, Luo Feng could only borrow a portion.

The reason Lord Xingmang couldn't peer into Luo Feng's future across countless timelines was due to interference from the Destruction World Force.

"Ah..." The moment the soul technique made contact with the Destruction World Force, Mogus vaguely saw the Destruction Abyss, even experiencing overwhelming negative emotions—countless killing intents, hatreds, grievances, fears—rushing toward it.

Its soul technique was also affected by the Destruction World Force.

Only thirty to forty percent of its power truly affected Luo Feng. "He has the protection of Destruction Abyss."

Mogus immediately understood this point. "Even soul power is obstructed and interfered with by the power of Destruction Abyss!" It had always been proud, always believing that as the same highest-level force, soul power surpassed all others...

But this time, in the face of Destruction Abyss's power, soul power was also hindered. "Truly worthy of being the power of the highest-level mysterious place!" Luo Feng could perceive that the Destruction World Force acted like his armor. After the soul techniques were weakened, his mental will could completely withstand them without being drawn in at all.

From beginning to end, he remained absolutely conscious, merely watching an illusion! "Brother Luo Feng is impressive, truly impressive. Far stronger than me. Hahaha. Let's use the Curse Killing Cataclysm Formation again." Yuan laughed heartily.

"Again!"

Lord Momann was excited, once again completely burning his main combat clone. They executed the Curse Killing Cataclysm Formation again. Although Lord Momann completely burning his main combat clone weakened the lords' defense battle formation, with only Momann missing, the lords' formation still maintained ninety percent of its defensive capability.

Luo Feng, Yuan, and Xing Mang were the three core members of the battle formation. "No!" Among the progenitor camp, Thousand-Eyed Progenitor was terrified and desperate.

In its terror, its life core had already cracked... As the second most fragile in physical body among the seven progenitors skilled in soul techniques, Thousand-Eyed Progenitor similarly failed to withstand the Curse Killing Cataclysm Formation and died instantly. At the moment of death, Thousand-Eyed Progenitor's corpse also disappeared...

Without a doubt, it was stolen by Xing Mang. "It's over!" "This is bad!" "We're going to lose!" The progenitors saw this scene and all understood this point.

The eight lords joining forces were flawless. As for soul techniques, although Yuan was briefly affected, he had now recovered. Luo Feng felt nothing at all. As for Xing Mang?

It was impossible to lock onto Xing Mang! All three targets were untouchable. Yet among the progenitors skilled in soul techniques, two had already died.

This war was already lost. If they continued fighting, only more progenitors would die.`,
